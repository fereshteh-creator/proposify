Past Literature After advancing the problem and reviewing the literature about it, the researcher then identifies deficiencies found in this literature. Hence, I call this template a deficiencies model for writing an introduction. The nature of these deficiencies varies from study to study. Deficiencies in past literature may exist because topics not have been explored with a particular group, sample, or population; the literature may need to be replicated or repeated to see if the same findings hold, given new samples of people or new sites for study; or the voice of underrepresented groups has not been heard in published literature.
