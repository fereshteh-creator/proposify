no significant difference exists between groups on a variable. Observational protocol is a form used by a qualitative researcher for recording and writing down information while observing. Phenomenological research is a qualitative strategy in which the researcher identifies the essence of human experiences about a phenomenon as described by participants in a study. Postpositivists reflect a deterministic philosophy about research in which causes probably determine effects or outcomes. Thus, the problems studied by postpositivists reflect issues that need to identify and assess the causes that influence the outcomes, such as found in experiments. Pragmatism as a worldview or philosophy arises out of actions, situations, and consequences rather than antecedent conditions (as in postpositivism). There is a concern with applications— what works—and solutions to problems. Instead of focusing on methods, researchers emphasize the research problem and use all approaches available to understand the problem. Purpose statement in a research proposal sets the objectives, the intent, and the major idea for the study. Purposefully select participants or sites (or documents or visual material) means that qualitative researchers select individuals who will best help them understand the research problem and the research questions. --- Seite 214 --- Qualitative audio and visual materials take
