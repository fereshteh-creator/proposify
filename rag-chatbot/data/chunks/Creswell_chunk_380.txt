effects of variables used in combination, thereby providing a rich and revealing multidimensional view (Keppel, 1991). In other experiments, the researcher studies only one group in what is called a within-group design. For example, in a repeated measures design, participants are assigned to different treatments at different times during the experiment. Another example of a within-group design would be a study of the behavior of a single individual over time in which the experimenter provides and withholds a treatment at different times in the experiment, to determine its impact. • Provide a diagram or a figure to illustrate the specific research design to be used. A standard notation system needs to be used in this figure. A research tip I recommend is to use a classic notation system provided by Campbell and Stanley (1963, p. 6): • X represents an exposure of a group to an experimental variable or event, the effects of which are to be measured. • O represents an observation or measurement recorded on an instrument. • X’s and O’s in a given row are applied to the same specific persons. X’s and O’s in the same column, or placed vertically relative to each other, are simultaneous.
