Multilevel sampling, in which sampling occurs in two or more levels or units of analysis • Sampling using any combination of the foregoing strategies • Include detailed procedures in your visual model. For example, in a sequential explanatory model, the general procedures are higher on the page and the detailed procedures below them, as shown in Figure 10.2a. However, the figure can be detailed even further. For example, a discussion of this approach might include describing the use of survey data collection followed by both descriptive and inferential data analysis in the first phase. Then qualitative observations and coding and thematic analysis within an ethnographic design might be mentioned for the second phase. DATA ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION PROCEDURES Data analysis in mixed methods research relates to the type of research strategy chosen for the procedures. Thus, in a proposal, the procedures need to be identified within the design. However, analysis occurs both within the quantitative (descriptive and inferential numeric analysis) and the qualitative (description and thematic text or image analysis) approach and often between the two approaches. For example, some of the more popular mixed methods data analysis approaches are the following (see Caracelli & Greene, 1993; Creswell & Plano
