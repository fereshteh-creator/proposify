Creswell and Plano Clark have developed two books that provide an introduction to mixed methods research and sample research studies and methodological articles about mixed methods research. In the first, we emphasize four types of mixed methods designs: explanatory sequential, exploratory sequential, triangulation, and the embedded designs and provide articles that illustrate each design. This design theme is carried forward in their Reader, in which additional articles are included that present actual research studies employing the designs as well as discussions surrounding the basic ideas of the four designs. Greene, J. C., Caracelli, V. J., & Graham, W. F. (1989). Toward a conceptual framework for mixed-method evaluation designs. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 11(3), 255-274. Jennifer Greene and associates undertook a study of 57 mixed methods evaluation studies reported from 1980 to 1988. From this analysis, they developed five different mixed methods purposes and seven design characteristics. They found the purposes of mixed methods studies to be based on seeking convergence (triangulation), examining different facets of a phenomenon (complementarity), using the methods sequentially (development), discovering paradox and
