These could be written at the beginning of a study or when they appear in the project if the study unfolds in --- Seite 133 --- stages or phases. With this approach, the emphasis is placed on the two approaches and not on the mixed methods or integrative component of the study. • Write separate quantitative questions or hypotheses and qualitative questions and follow them with a mixed methods question. This highlights the importance of both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study as well as their combined strength, and thus is probably the ideal approach. • Write only a mixed methods question that reflects the procedures or the content (or write the mixed methods question in both a procedural and a content approach), and do not include separate quantitative and qualitative questions. This approach would enhance the viewpoint that the study intends to lead to some integration or connection between the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study (i.e., the sum of both parts is greater than each part).
