consistent with the method being used. For example, if the study begins with a quantitative phase, then the investigator is likely to include a substantial literature review that helps to establish a rationale for the research questions or hypotheses. If the study begins with a qualitative phase, then the literature is substantially less, and the researcher may incorporate it more into the end of the study—an inductive approach. If the researcher advances a concurrent study with an equal weight and emphasis on both qualitative and quantitative data, then the literature may take either qualitative or quantitative forms. To recap, the literature use in a mixed methods project will depend on the strategy and the relative weight given to the qualitative or quantitative research in the study. My suggestions for using the literature in planning a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods study are as follows: • In a qualitative study, use the literature sparingly in the beginning in order to convey an inductive design, unless the design type requires a substantial literature orientation at the outset. • Consider the most appropriate place for the literature in a qualitative study, and base the decision on the audience for the project.
