to a proposal, shapes a directional research question aimed at exploring a problem (e.g., inequality, discrimination, injustice), creates sensitivity to collecting data from marginalized or underrepresented groups, and ends with a call for action. In this design the researcher may use either method in the first phase of research, and the weight can be given to either or distributed evenly to both phases. The mixing is connected as in all sequential designs. Unlike the sequential exploratory and explanatory approaches, the sequential transformative model has a theoretical perspective to guide the study. The aim of this theoretical perspective, whether it be a conceptual framework, a specific ideology, or advocacy, is more important in guiding the study than the use of methods alone. The purpose of a sequential transformative strategy is to best serve the theoretical perspective of the researcher. By using two phases, a sequential transformative researcher may be able to give voice to diverse perspectives, to better advocate for participants, or to better understand a phenomenon or process that is changing as a result of being studied. The sequential transformative model shares the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the other two sequential approaches. Its use of distinct phases facilitates its
