as well as the specific types of data collected during the study. The introduction focused on the need to examine organizational commitment and commitment to student learning, leading to a priority for the quantitative approach. This priority was further illustrated in sections defining organizational commitment and commitment to student learning and the use of extensive literature to document these two concepts. A conceptual framework then followed, complete with a visual model, and research questions were posed to explore relationships. This provided a theoretical lead for the quantitative phase of the study (Morse, 1991). The implementation was QUAN→qual in this two-phase study. The author presented results in two phases, with the first—the quantitative results—displaying and discussing correlations, regressions, and two-way ANOVAs.
