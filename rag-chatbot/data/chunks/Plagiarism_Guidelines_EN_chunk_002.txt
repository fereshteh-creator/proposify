in which the student pledges not to commit plagiarism during his studies. Submission and electronic monitoring of assignments Art. 2 1 To facilitate the electronic monitoring process, all larger assignments are to be submitted, as far as technically possible and reasonable, in both printed as well as electronic format. 2 A standardized software solution is used to electronically monitor written assignments. The specific application of the electronic monitoring process is determined by each university department. In the absence of guidelines to this effect, electronic monitoring is at the discretion of the responsible lecturer [added as of June 30th, 2011]. Procedures and due process in suspected cases Art. 3 3 In a suspected case, the responsible lecturer supplies evidence to support the claim of suspected plagiarism and notifies the student of this suspicion. 4 The student has 14 days to respond to the accusation of plagiarism. 5 The lecturer subsequently forwards a copy of all of the documents to the head of the course of studies. The head of the course of studies then makes a decision based on the documents supplied (lecturer's report, student's response), as to whether it is actually a case of plagiarism.
