Before proceeding with a proposal or a study, one needs to weigh these factors and ask others for their reaction to a topic under consideration. Seek reactions from colleagues, noted authorities in the field, academic advisers, and faculty committee members. --- Seite 41 --- THE LITERATURE REVIEW Once the researcher identifies a topic that can and should be studied, the search can begin for related literature on the topic.
