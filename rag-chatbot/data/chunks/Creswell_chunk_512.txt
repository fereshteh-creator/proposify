201 --- qualitative interviews (e.g., with individuals) to explore the phenomenon with specific individuals in the families. • Create a matrix: When comparing data in a concurrent type of approach, combine information from both the quantitative and qualitative data collection into a matrix. The horizontal axis of this matrix could be a quantitative categorical variable (e.g., type of provider—nurse, physician, and medical assistant) and the vertical axis would be the qualitative data (e.g., five themes about caring relationships between providers and patients). Information in the cells could be either quotes from the qualitative data, counts of the number of codes from the qualitative data, or some combination. In this way, the matrix would present an analysis of the combined qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative computer software programs provide matrix output capabilities for the mixed methods researcher (see Chapter 9). Another aspect of data analysis in mixed methods research to describe in a proposal is the series of steps taken to check the validity of both the quantitative data and the accuracy of the qualitative findings. Writers on mixed methods advocate for the use of validity procedures for both the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).
