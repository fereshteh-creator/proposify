variables may simply be measured variables in which no manipulation occurs (e.g., attitudes or personal characteristics of participants). Still other independent variables can be statistically controlled, such as demographics (e.g., gender or age). The method section must list and clearly identify all the independent variables in an experiment. • Identify the dependent variable or variables (i.e., the outcomes) in the experiment. The dependent variable is the response or the criterion variable that is presumed to be caused by or influenced by the independent treatment conditions and any other independent variables). Rosenthal and Rosnow (1991) advanced three prototypic outcomes measures: the direction of observed change, the amount of this change, and the ease with which the participant changes (e.g., the participant reacquires the correct response as in a single-subject design). Instrumentation and Materials During an experiment, one makes observations or obtains measures using instruments at a pre- test or post-test (or both) stage of the procedures. A sound research plan calls for a thorough discussion about the instrument or instruments— their development, their items, their scales, and reports of reliability and validity of scores on past uses. The researcher also should report on the materials used for the experimental treatment (e.g.,
