a research study. This requires that inquirers, especially in qualitative studies involving prolonged observation or interviewing at a site, be cognizant of their impact and minimize their disruption of the physical setting. For example, they might time visits so that they intrude little on the flow of activities of participants. Also, organizations often have guidelines that provide guidance for conducting research without disturbing their settings. • In experimental studies, investigators need to collect data so that all participants, not only an experimental group, benefit from the treatments. This may require providing some treatment to all groups or staging the treatment so that ultimately all groups receive the beneficial treatment. • An ethical issue arises when there is not reciprocity between the researcher and the participants. Both the researcher and the participants should benefit from the research. In some situations, power can easily be abused and participants can be coerced into a project. Involving individuals collaboratively in the research may provide reciprocity. Highly collaborative studies, popular in qualitative research, may engage participants as co- researchers throughout the research process, such as the design, data collection and analysis, report writing, and dissemination of the findings (Patton, 2002). • Interviewing in qualitative research
