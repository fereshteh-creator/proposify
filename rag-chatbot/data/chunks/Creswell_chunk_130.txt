for conceptualizing the literature to be introduced in a journal article. Consider a literature review to be composed of five components: an introduction, Topic 1 (about the independent variable), Topic 2 (about the dependent variable), Topic 3, (studies that address both the independent and dependent variables), and a summary. Here is more detail about each section: 1. Introduce the review by telling the reader about the sections included in it. This passage is a statement about the organization of the section. 2. Review Topic 1, which addresses the scholarly literature about the independent variable or variables. With several independent variables, consider subsections or focus on the single most important variable. Remember to address only the literature about the independent variable; keep the literature about the independent and dependent variables separate in this model. 3. Review Topic 2, which incorporates the scholarly literature about the dependent variable or variables. With multiple dependent variables, write subsections about each variable or focus on a single important dependent variable. 4. Review Topic 3, which includes the scholarly literature that relates the independent variable(s) to the dependent variable(s). Here we are at the crux of the proposed study. Thus, this section should be relatively short
