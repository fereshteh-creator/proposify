Like the concurrent triangulation approach, the concurrent embedded strategy of mixed methods can be identified by its use of one data collection phase, during which both quantitative and qualitative data are collected simultaneously (see Figure 10.3b). Unlike the traditional triangulation model, a concurrent embedded approach has a primary method that guides the project and a secondary database that provides a supporting role in the procedures. Given less priority, the secondary method (quantitative or qualitative) is embedded, or nested, within the predominant method (qualitative or quantitative). This embedding may mean that the secondary method addresses a different question than the primary method (e.g., in an experiment, the quantitative data addresses the outcomes expected from the treatments while the qualitative data explores the processes experienced by individuals in the treatment groups) or seeks information at a different level of analysis (the analogy to hierarchical analysis in quantitative research is helpful in conceptualizing these levels—see Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). The mixing of the data from the two methods is often to integrate the information and compare one data source with the other, typically accomplished in a discussion section of a study. However, the data may also not be compared but reside side by
