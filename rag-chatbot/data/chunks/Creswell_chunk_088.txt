Also, the literature review can introduce a theory—an explanation for expected relationships (see Chapter 3), describe the theory that will be used, and suggest why it is a useful theory to examine.

In this model, the quantitative researcher uses the literature deductively as a framework for the research questions or hypotheses. --- Seite 43 --- Cooper (1984) suggests that literature reviews can be integrative, in which the researchers summarize broad themes in the literature.
