mixed methods seminars. These courses have been my laboratories for working out ideas, incorporating new ones, and sharing my experiences as a writer and researcher. My staff in the Office of Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has also helped out extensively. I am indebted to the scholarly work of Dr. Vicki Plano Clark, Dr. Ron Shope, Dr. Kim Galt, Dr. Yun Lu, Sherry Wang, Amanda Garrett, and Alex Morales. In addition, I am grateful for the insightful suggestions provided by the reviewers for Sage Publications. I also could not have produced this book without the support and encouragement of my friends at Sage Publications. Sage is and has been a first-rate publishing house. I especially owe much to my former editor and mentor, C. Deborah Laughton (now of Guilford Press), and to Lisa Cuevas-Shaw, Vicki Knight, and Stephanie Adams. Throughout almost 20 years of working with Sage, we have grown together to help develop research methods. Sage Publications and I gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the following reviewers: Mahasweta M. Banerjee, University of Kansas Miriam W. Boeri, Kennesaw State University Sharon Anderson Dannels, The George Washington University Sean A. Forbes, Auburn University Alexia S. Georgakopoulos,
