collection. The design may or may not be implemented within an explicit theoretical perspective (see Figure 10.2b). At the most basic level, the purpose of this strategy is to use quantitative data and results to assist in the interpretation of qualitative findings. Unlike the sequential explanatory approach, which is better suited to explaining and interpreting relationships, the primary focus of this model is to initially explore a phenomenon. Morgan (1998) suggested that this design is appropriate to use when testing elements of an emergent theory resulting from the qualitative phase and that it can also be used to generalize qualitative findings to different samples. Similarly, Morse (1991) cited one purpose for selecting this approach: to determine the distribution of a phenomenon within a chosen population. Finally, the sequential exploratory strategy is often discussed as the procedure of choice when a researcher needs to develop an instrument because existing instruments are inadequate or not available. Using a three-phase approach, the researcher first gathers qualitative data and analyzes it (Phase 1), and uses the analysis to development an instrument (Phase 2) that is subsequently administered to a sample of a population (Phase 3; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007).
