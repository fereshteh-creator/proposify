the researcher gradually makes sense of a social phenomenon by contrasting, comparing, replicating, cataloguing and classifying the object of study (Miles & Huberman, 1984). Marshall and Rossman (1989) suggest that this entails immersion in the everyday life of the setting chosen for the study; the researcher enters the informants’ world and through ongoing interaction, seeks the informants’ perspectives and meanings. [Qualitative assumptions are mentioned.] Scholars contend that qualitative research can be distinguished from quantitative methodology by numerous unique characteristics that are inherent in the design. The following is a synthesis of commonly articulated assumptions regarding characteristics presented by various researchers. 1. Qualitative research occurs in natural settings, where human behavior and events occur. 2. Qualitative research is based on assumptions that are very different from quantitative designs. Theory or hypotheses are not established a priori. 3. The researcher is the primary instrument in data collection rather than some inanimate mechanism (Eisner, 1991; Frankel & Wallen, 1990; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Merriam, 1988). 4. The data that emerge from a qualitative study are descriptive. That is, data are reported in words (primarily the participant’s words) or pictures, rather than in numbers (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1990; Locke et al., 1987; Marshall &
