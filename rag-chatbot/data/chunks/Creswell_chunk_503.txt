qualitative data to best converge information to provide evidence for an inequality of policies in an organization. Thus, the concurrent transformative model may take on the design features of either a triangulation or an embedded approach (the two types of data are collected at the same time during one data collection phase and may have equal or unequal priority). The mixing of the data would be through merging, connecting, or embedding the data. Because the concurrent transformative model shares features with the triangulation and embedded approaches, it also shares their specific strengths and weaknesses. However, this model has the added advantage of positioning mixed methods research within a transformative framework, which may make it especially appealing to those qualitative or quantitative researchers already using a transformative framework to guide their inquiry. Choosing a Mixed Methods Strategy Proposal developers need to convey the specific strategy for mixed methods data collection they plan to use. Further, they need to advance a visual figure that presents the procedures they plan to use. Figures 10.2 and 10.3 provide some useful models for guidance. Here are some research tips about how to select a mixed methods strategy: • Use the information in Figure 10.1 to
