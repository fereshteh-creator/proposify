begun to develop a bilingual nomenclature for mixed methods research and have called validity legitimation (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 55). The legitimation of the mixed methods study relates to many phases of the research process, from philosophical issues (e.g., are the philosophical positions blended into a usable form?) to inferences drawn (e.g., yield high-quality inferences) and to the value of the study for consumers (see Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006). For individuals writing a mixed methods research proposal, consider the types of validity associated with the quantitative component (see Chapter 8), validity related to the qualitative strand (see Chapter 9), and any validity issues that might arise that relate to the mixed methods approach. Validity issues in mixed methods research may relate to the types of strategies discussed in this chapter. These may relate to sample selection, sample size, follow up on contradictory results, bias in data collection, inadequate procedures, or the use of conflicting research questions (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007 for a discussion of these ideas). REPORT PRESENTATION STRUCTURE The structure for the report, like the data analysis, follows the type of strategy chosen for the proposed study. Because mixed methods studies may not be familiar to
