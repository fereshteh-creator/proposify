the problem is, of course, contingent on available studies. One can find illustrations of this model in many qualitative studies employing different types of inquiry strategy. Table 2.1 Using Literature in a Qualitative Study A second form is to review the literature in a separate section, a model typically used in quantitative research, often found in journals with a quantitative orientation. In theory- oriented qualitative studies, such as ethnography, critical theory, or an advocacy or emancipatory aim, the inquirer might locate the theory discussion and literature in a separate section, typically toward the beginning of the write-up.
