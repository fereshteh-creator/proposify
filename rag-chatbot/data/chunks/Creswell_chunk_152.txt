Dependent Variable Mediated by Two Intervening Variables --- Seite 63 --- • Position the dependent variables on the right in the diagram and the independent variables on the left. • Use one-way arrows leading from each determining variable to each variable dependent on it. • Indicate the strength of the relationship among variables by inserting valence signs on the paths. Use positive or negative valences that postulate or infer relationships. • Use two-headed arrows connected to show unanalyzed relationships between variables not dependent upon other relationships in the model. More complicated causal diagrams can be constructed with additional notation. This one portrays a basic model of limited variables, such as typically found in a survey research study. A variation on this theme is to have independent variables in which control and experimental groups are compared on one independent variable in terms of an outcome (dependent variable). As shown in Figure 3.2, two groups on variable X are compared in terms of their influence on Y, the dependent variable. This design is a between-groups experimental design (see Chapter 8). The same rules of notation previously discussed apply. These two models are meant only to introduce possibilities for connecting independent and dependent
