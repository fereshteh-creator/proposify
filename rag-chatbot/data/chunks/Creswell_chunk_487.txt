or method is emphasized. • “Quan” and “Qual” stand for quantitative and qualitative, respectively, and they use the same number of letters to indicate equality between the forms of data. • A QUAN/qual notation indicates that the qualitative methods are embedded within a quantitative design. • Boxes highlight the quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. In addition, incorporated into each figure are specific data collection, analysis, and interpretation procedures to help the reader understand the more specific procedures used. In this way, a figure has at least two elements: the general procedure of mixed methods being used and the more specific procedures of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Sequential Explanatory Strategy The sequential explanatory strategy is a popular strategy for mixed methods design that often appeals to researchers with strong quantitative leanings. It is characterized by the collection and analysis of quantitative data in a first phase of research followed by the collection and analysis of qualitative data in a second phase that builds on the results of the initial quantitative results. Weight typically is given to the quantitative data, and the mixing of the data occurs when the initial quantitative results informs the secondary qualitative data collection. Thus,
