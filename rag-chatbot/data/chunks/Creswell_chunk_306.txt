a longitudinal study employing multiple surveys over a three-year period, logistic regression was used to identify the factors most strongly associated with parental savings for postsecondary education. In addition, insights gained from the interviews of a small subsample of students and parents who were interviewed five times during the three-year period are used to further examine parental savings. (Hossler & Vesper, 1991, p. 141) This section was contained under the heading “Purpose,” and it indicated that both quantitative data (i.e., surveys) and qualitative data (i.e., interviews) were included in the study. Both forms of data were collected during the 3-year period, and the authors might have identified their study as a triangulation or concurrent design. Although the rationale for the study is not included in this passage, it is articulated later, in the methods discussion about surveys and interviews. Here we find that “the interviews were also used to explore variables under investigation in greater detail and triangulate findings using quantitative and qualitative data” (Hossler & Vesper, 1993, p. 146).
