essential steps in designing quantitative methods for a research proposal or study, with specific focus on survey and experimental designs. These designs reflect postpositivist philosophical assumptions, as discussed in Chapter 1. For example, determinism suggests that examining the relationships between and among variables is central to answering questions and hypotheses through surveys and experiments. The reduction to a parsimonious set of variables, tightly controlled through design or statistical analysis, provides measures or observations for testing a theory. Objective data result from empirical observations and measures. Validity and reliability of scores on instruments lead to meaningful interpretations of data. In relating these assumptions and the procedures that implement them, this discussion does not exhaustively treat quantitative research methods. Excellent, detailed texts provide information about survey research (e.g., see Babbie, 1990, 2007; Fink, 2002; Salant & Dillman, 1994). For experimental procedures, some traditional books (e.g., Campbell & Stanley, 1963; Cook & Campbell, 1979), as well as some newer texts, extend the ideas presented here (e.g., Bausell, 1994; Boruch, 1998; Field & Hole, 2003; Keppel, 1991; Lipsey, 1990; Reichardt & Mark, 1998). In this chapter, the focus is on the essential components of a method section in proposals for a survey and an
