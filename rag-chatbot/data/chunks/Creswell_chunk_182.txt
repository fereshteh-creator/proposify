The design in this study gave “primacy to the value-based and action-oriented dimensions of different inquiry traditions” (Greene & Caracelli, 1997, p. 24) in a mixed methods study. The authors used a theoretical lens for reconfiguring the language and dialogue of participants, and they advanced the importance of empowerment in research. In using theory in a mixed methods proposal, --- Seite 76 --- • Determine if theory is to be used. • Identify its use in accord with quantitative or qualitative approaches. • If theory is used as in a transformational strategy of inquiry, define this strategy and discuss the points in the proposed study in which the emancipatory ideas will be used.

Thus, it is essential to have grounding in the nature and use of variables as they form research questions and hypotheses. A theory explains how and why the variables are related, acting as a bridge between or among the variables. Theory may be broad or narrow in scope,
