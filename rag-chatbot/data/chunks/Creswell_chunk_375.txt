these three factors (e.g., alpha = .05, power = .80, and effect size = .50) and can look up in a table the size needed for each group (see Cohen, 1977; Lipsey, 1990). In this way, the experiment is planned so that the size of each treatment group provides the greatest sensitivity that the effect on the outcome actually is due to the experimental manipulation in the study. Variables The variables need to be specified in an experiment so that it is clear to readers what groups are receiving the experimental treatment and what outcomes are being measured. Here are some suggestions for developing ideas about variables in a proposal: • Clearly identify the independent variables in the experiment (recall the discussion of variables in Chapter 3). One independent variable must be the treatment variable. One or more groups receive the experimental manipulation, or treatment, from the researcher. Other independent variables may simply be measured variables in which no manipulation occurs (e.g., attitudes or personal characteristics of participants). Still other independent variables can be statistically controlled, such as demographics (e.g., gender or age). The method section must list and clearly identify all the independent variables in an experiment. • Identify
