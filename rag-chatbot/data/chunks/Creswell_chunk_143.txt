that result may be due to (a) their study preparation (independent variable) and/or (b) their organization of study ideas into a framework (intervening variable) that influenced their performance on the test. The mediating variable, the organization of study, stands between the independent and dependent variables. • Moderating variables are new variables constructed by a researcher by taking one variable and multiplying it by another to determine the joint impact of both (e.g., age X attitudes toward quality of life). These variables are typically found in experiments. • Two other types of variables are control variables and confounding variables. Control variables play an active role in quantitative studies. These are a special type of independent variable that researchers measure because they potentially influence the dependent variable. Researchers use statistical procedures (e.g., analysis of covariance) to control for these variables. They may be demographic or personal variables (e.g., age or gender) that need to be “controlled” so that the true influence of the independent variable on the dependent can be determined. Another type of variable, a confounding (or spurious) variable, is not actually measured or observed in a study. It exists, but its influence cannot be directly detected. Researchers comment on the
