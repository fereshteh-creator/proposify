study. When students first provide their prospectuses of a research study to me, I ask them to supply a working title if they do not already have one on the paper. How would this working title be written? Try completing this sentence, “My study is about. . . .” A response might be, “My study is about at-risk children in the junior high,” or “My study is about helping college faculty become better researchers.” At this stage in the design, frame the answer to the question so that another scholar might easily grasp the meaning of the project. A common shortcoming of beginning researchers is that they frame their study in complex and erudite language. This perspective may result from reading published articles that have undergone numerous revisions before being set in print. Good, sound research projects begin with straightforward, uncomplicated thoughts, easy to read and to understand. Think about a journal article that you have read recently. If it was easy and quick to read, it was likely written in general language that many readers could easily identify with, in a way that was straightforward and simple in overall design and conceptualization. --- Seite 40 --- Wilkinson (1991) provides
