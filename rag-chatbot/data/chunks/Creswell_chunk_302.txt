___________ (dependent variable) for ___________ (sample of population) at ___________ (research site). The reason for collecting qualitative data initially is that ___________ (e.g., instruments are inadequate or not available, variables are not known, there is little guiding theory or few taxonomies). 2. A sequential study with the qualitative follow-up phase building on and helping to explain the initial quantitative phase: The intent of this two-phase, sequential mixed methods study will be to ___________ (mention content objective of the study). In the first phase, quantitative research questions or hypotheses will address the ___________ relationship or comparison of ___________ (independent) and ___________ (dependent) variables with ___________ (participants) at ___________ (the research site). Information from this first phase will be explored further in a second qualitative phase. In the second phase, qualitative interviews or observations will be used to probe significant ___________ (quantitative results) by exploring aspects of the ___________ (central phenomenon) with ___________ (a few participants) at ___________ (research site). The reason for following up with qualitative research in the second phase is to ___________ (e.g., better understand and explain the quantitative results). 3. A concurrent study with the intent of gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and merging or integrating them
