the discussion in Chapter 2). --- Seite 180 --- Example 9.1Qualitative Procedures The following is an example of a qualitative procedure written as part of a doctoral proposal (Miller, 1992). Miller’s project was an ethnographic study of first-year experiences of the president of a 4-year college. As I present this discussion, I refer back to the sections addressed in this chapter and highlight them in boldfaced type. Also, I have maintained Miller’s use of the term informant, although today, the more appropriate term, participant, should be used. The Qualitative Research Paradigm The qualitative research paradigm has its roots in cultural anthropology and American sociology (Kirk & Miller, 1986). It has only recently been adopted by educational researchers (Borg & Gall, 1989). The intent of qualitative research is to understand a particular social situation, event, role, group, or interaction (Locke, Spirduso, & Silverman, 1987). It is largely an investigative process where the researcher gradually makes sense of a social phenomenon by contrasting, comparing, replicating, cataloguing and classifying the object of study (Miles & Huberman, 1984). Marshall and Rossman (1989) suggest that this entails immersion in the everyday life of the setting chosen for the study; the researcher enters the informants’ world
