qualitative data and comparing the two data sources. In addition, the concurrent data collection results in a shorter data collection time period as compared to one of the sequential approaches because both the qualitative and quantitative data are gathered at one time at the research site. This model also has a number of limitations. It requires great effort and expertise to adequately study a phenomenon with two separate methods. It also can be difficult to compare the results of two analyses using data of different forms. In addition, a researcher may be unclear how to resolve discrepancies that arise in comparing the results, although procedures are emerging in the literature, such as conducting additional data collection to resolve the discrepancy, revisiting the original database, gaining new insight from the disparity of the data, or developing a new project that addresses the discrepancy (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). Concurrent Embedded Strategy Like the concurrent triangulation approach, the concurrent embedded strategy of mixed methods can be identified by its use of one data collection phase, during which both quantitative and qualitative data are collected simultaneously (see Figure 10.3b). Unlike the traditional triangulation model, a concurrent embedded approach has a primary method that
