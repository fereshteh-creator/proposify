group learn how to study a subject using computers. A pilot test of these materials may also be discussed, as well as any training required to administer the materials in a standard way. The intent of this pilot test is to ensure that materials can be administered without variability to the experimental group. --- Seite 149 --- Experimental Procedures The specific experimental design procedures also need to be identified. This discussion involves indicating the overall experiment type, citing reasons for the design, and advancing a visual model to help the reader understand the procedures. • Identify the type of experimental design to be used in the proposed study. The types available in experiments are pre-experimental designs, true experiments, quasi-experiments, and single- subject designs. With pre-experimental designs, the researcher studies a single group and provides an intervention during the experiment. This design does not have a control group to compare with the experimental group. In quasi-experiments, the investigator uses control and experimental groups but does not randomly assign participants to groups (e.g., they may be intact groups available to the researcher). In a true experiment, the investigator randomly assigns the participants to treatment groups. A single-subject design or N of 1
