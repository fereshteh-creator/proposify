In a mixed methods study, the qualitative and quantitative data may be equally emphasized, or one may be more emphasized than the other. Capitalization indicates that an approach or method is emphasized. • “Quan” and “Qual” stand for quantitative and qualitative, respectively, and they use the same number of letters to indicate equality between the forms of data. • A QUAN/qual notation indicates that the qualitative methods are embedded within a quantitative design. • Boxes highlight the quantitative
