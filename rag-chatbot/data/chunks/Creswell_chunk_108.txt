in organizational studies (Janovec, 2001). Janovec’s map illustrates a hierarchical design, and she used several principles of good map design. • She placed her topic in the box at the top of the hierarchy. • Next, she took the studies that she found in computer searches, located copies of these studies, and organized them into three broad subtopics (i.e., Justice Perceptions Formation, Justice Effects, and Justice in Organizational Change). For another map, the researcher may have more or fewer than four major categories, depending on the extent and publications on the topic. • Within each box are labels that describe the nature of the studies in the box (i.e., outcomes). • Also within each box are references to major citations illustrating its content. It is useful to use references that are current, illustrative of the topic of the box and to briefly state the references in an appropriate style, such as APA. • Consider several levels for the literature map. In other words, major topics lead to subtopics and then to sub-subtopics.
