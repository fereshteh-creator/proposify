both) stage of the procedures. A sound research plan calls for a thorough discussion about the instrument or instruments— their development, their items, their scales, and reports of reliability and validity of scores on past uses. The researcher also should report on the materials used for the experimental treatment (e.g., the special program or specific activities given to the experimental group). • Describe the instrument or instruments participants complete in the experiment, typically completed before the experiment begins and at its end. Indicate the established validity and reliability of the scores on instruments, the individuals who developed them, and any permissions needed to use them. • Thoroughly discuss the materials used for the experimental treatment. One group, for example, may participate in a special computer-assisted learning plan used by a teacher in a classroom. This plan might involve handouts, lessons, and special written instructions to help students in this experimental group learn how to study a subject using computers. A pilot test of these materials may also be discussed, as well as any training required to administer the materials in a standard way. The intent of this pilot test is to ensure that materials can be administered without variability to
