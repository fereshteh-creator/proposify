her project would extend. She proposed this study based on ideas written by other authors in the future research sections of their studies. • Include quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies in your literature map. Abstracting Studies When researchers write reviews of the literature for proposed studies, they locate articles and develop brief abstracts of the articles that comprise the review. An abstract is a brief review of the literature (typically in a short paragraph) that summarizes major elements, to enable a reader to understand the basic features of the article. In developing an abstract, researchers need to consider what material to extract and summarize. This is important information when reviewing perhaps dozens, if not hundreds, of studies. A good summary of a research study reported in a journal might include the following points: • Mention the problem being addressed. • State the central purpose or focus of the study. • Briefly state information about the sample, population, or subjects. • Review key results that relate to the proposed study. • If it is a methodological review (Cooper, 1984), point out technical and methodological flaws in the study.
