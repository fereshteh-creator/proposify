field. • Remember that the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data is a rigorous, time-consuming process. When time is a problem, I encourage students to think about an embedded model of design. This model emphasizes a major primary form of data collection (e.g., surveys), and it can include a minor secondary form of data collection (e.g., a few interviews with some of the participants who completed the surveys). The fact that both forms of data are not equal in size and rigor enables the study to be reduced in scope and manageable for the time and resources available. • Consider using the explanatory sequential approach. It is a favorite of many students, especially those who have little experience with qualitative research and substantial background in quantitative research. In this approach, an initial quantitative data collection is followed by a secondary qualitative data collection to follow up the quantitative results. • Study published articles that use different approaches and determine which one makes the most sense to you. Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) include four complete journal articles so that readers can examine the detail of studies employing different forms of designs. • Find a published mixed methods
