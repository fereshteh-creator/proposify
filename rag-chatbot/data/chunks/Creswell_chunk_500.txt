example, Morse (1991) noted that a primarily qualitative design could embed some quantitative data to enrich the description of the sample participants. Likewise, she described how qualitative data could be used to describe an aspect of a quantitative study that cannot be quantified. In addition, a concurrent embedded model may be employed when a researcher chooses to utilize different methods to study different groups or levels. For example, if an organization is being studied, employees could be studied quantitatively, managers could be interviewed qualitatively, entire divisions could be analyzed with quantitative data, and so forth. Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998) described this approach as a multilevel design. Finally, one method could be used within a framework of the other method, such as if a researcher designed and conducted an experiment --- Seite 198 --- to examine treatment outcomes but used case study methodology to study how participants in the study experienced the treatment procedures. This mixed methods model is attractive for several reasons. A researcher is able to collect the two types of data simultaneously, during a single data collection phase. It provides a study with the advantages of both quantitative and qualitative data. In addition, by using the two different
