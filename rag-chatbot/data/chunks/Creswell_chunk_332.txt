A final set of questions may add inferential questions or hypotheses in which variables are controlled. Example 7.7Descriptive and Inferential Questions To illustrate this approach, a researcher wants to examine the relationship of critical thinking skills (an independent variable measured on an instrument) to student achievement (a dependent variable measured by grades) in science classes for eighth-grade students in a large metropolitan school district. The researcher controls for the intervening effects of prior grades in science classes and parents’ educational attainment. Following the proposed model, the research questions might be written as follows: Descriptive Questions 1. How do the students rate on critical thinking skills? (A descriptive question focused on the independent variable) 2. What are the student’s achievement levels (or grades) in science classes? (A descriptive question focused on the dependent variable) 3. What are the student’s prior grades in science classes? (A descriptive question focused on the control variable of prior grades) 4. What is the educational attainment of the parents of the eighth-graders? (A descriptive question focused on another control variable, educational attainment of parents) Inferential Questions 1. Does critical thinking ability relate to student achievement? (An inferential question relating the independent and the dependent variables) 2.
