a distinct methodology of inquiry (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). • Define mixed methods research by incorporating the definition in Chapter 1 that focuses on combining both quantitative and qualitative research and methods in a research study (see a more expanded view of defining mixed methods research in Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, & Turner, 2007). Highlight the reasons why researchers employ a mixed methods design (e.g., to broaden understanding by incorporating both qualitative and quantitative research, or to use one approach to better understand, explain, or build on the results from the other approach). Also note that the mixing of the two might be within one study or among several studies in a program of inquiry. Recognize that many different terms are used for this approach, such as integrating, synthesis, quantitative and qualitative methods, multimethod, and mixed methodology, but that recent writings use the term mixed methods (Bryman, 2006; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003).
