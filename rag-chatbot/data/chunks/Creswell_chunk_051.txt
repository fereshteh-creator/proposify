methods designs or models that provide specific direction for procedures in a research design. Others have called them approaches to inquiry (Creswell, 2007) or research methodologies (Mertens, 1998). The strategies available to the --- Seite 29 --- researcher have grown over the years as computer technology has pushed forward our data analysis and ability to analyze complex models and as individuals have articulated new procedures for conducting social science research. Select types will be emphasized in Chapters 8, 9, and 10, strategies frequently used in the social sciences. Here I introduce those that are discussed later and that are cited in examples throughout the book. An overview of these strategies is shown in Table 1.2. Table 1.2 Alternative Strategies of Inquiry Quantitative Strategies During the late 19th and throughout the 20th century, strategies of inquiry associated with quantitative research were those that invoked the postpositivist worldview. These include true experiments and the less rigorous experiments called quasi-experiments and correlational studies (Campbell & Stanley, 1963) and specific single-subject experiments (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 1987; Neuman & McCormick, 1995). More recently, quantitative strategies have involved complex experiments with many variables and treatments (e.g., factorial designs and repeated measure designs). They have also
