but several suggestions follow (see also Locke et al., 2007): • Define a term when it first appears in the proposal. In the introduction, for example, a term may require definition to help the reader understand the research problem and questions or hypotheses in the study. • Write definitions at a specific operational or applied level. Operational definitions are written in specific language rather than abstract, conceptual definitions. Since the definition section in a dissertation provides an opportunity for the author to be specific about the terms used in the study, a preference exists for operational definitions. • Do not define the terms in everyday language; instead, use accepted language available in the research literature. In this way, the terms are grounded in the literature and not invented (Locke et al., 2007). It is possible that the precise definition of a term is not available in the literature and everyday language will need to be used. In this case, provide a definition and use the term consistently throughout the plan and the study (Wilkinson, 1991). • Researchers might define terms so that they accomplish different goals. A definition may describe a common language word (e.g., organization). It may also be
