be a theory from the social sciences (e.g., adoption theory, leadership theory, attribution theory) or a broad theoretical lens, such as an advocacy/participatory lens (e.g., gender, race, class; see Chapter 3). All researchers bring theories, frameworks and hunches to their inquiries, and these theories may be made explicit in a mixed methods study or be implicit and not mentioned. We will focus here on the use of explicit theories. In mixed methods studies, the theories are found typically in the beginning sections as an orienting lens that shapes the types of questions asked, who participates in the study, how data are collected, and the implications made from the study (typically for change and advocacy). They present an overarching perspective used with all of the mixed methods strategies of inquiry (to be presently discussed). Mertens (2003) provides a good discussion as to how a transforming lens shapes all phases of the research process in mixed methods research. Alternative Strategies and Visual Models These four factors—timing, weight, mixing, and theorizing—help to shape the procedures of a mixed methods study. Although these do not exhaust all the possibilities, there are six major strategies for inquirers to choose from in designing a research proposal;
