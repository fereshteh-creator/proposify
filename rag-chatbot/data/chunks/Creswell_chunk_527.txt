three types of strategies— sequential, concurrent, and transformative—has a different structural approach to writing a mixed methods study. Writing Exercises 1. Design a combined qualitative and quantitative study that employs two phases sequentially. Discuss and provide a rationale for why the phases are ordered in the sequence you propose. 2. Design a combined qualitative and quantitative study that gives priority to qualitative data collection and less priority to quantitative data collection. Discuss the approach to be taken in writing the introduction, the purpose statement, the research questions, and the specific forms of data collection. 3. Develop a visual figure and specific procedures that illustrate the use of a theoretical lens, such as a feminist perspective. Use the procedures of either a sequential or concurrent model for conducting the study. Use appropriate notation in the figure. ADDITIONAL READINGS Creswell, J. W., & Plano Clark, V. L. (2007).
