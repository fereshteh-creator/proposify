in mind the appropriate form for types of references and pay close attention to the format for multiple citations. • When writing the end-of-text references, note whether the style manual calls for them to be alphabetized or numbered. Also, cross-check that each in-text reference is included in the end- of-text list. • The headings are ordered in a scholarly paper in terms of levels. First, note how many levels of headings you will have in your research study. Then, refer to the style manual for the appropriate format for each. Typically, research reports contains between two and four levels of headings. • If footnotes are used, consult the style manual for their proper placement. Footnotes are used less frequently in scholarly papers today than a few years ago. If you include them, note whether they go at the bottom of the page, the end of each chapter, or at the end of the paper. • Tables and figures have a specific form in each style manual. Note such aspects as bold lines, titles, and spacing in the examples given. In summary, the most important aspect of using a style manual is to be consistent in the approach throughout the manuscript.
