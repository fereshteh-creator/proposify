need for precision, one finds terms stated early in the introduction to articles. In dissertations and thesis proposals, terms are typically defined in a special section of the study. The rationale is that in formal research, students must be precise in how they use language and terms. The need to ground thoughts in authoritative definitions constitutes good science. Define terms introduced in all sections of the research plan: • The title of the study • The problem statement • The purpose statement • The research questions, hypotheses, or objectives • The literature review • The theory base of the study • The methods section Special terms that need to be defined appear in all three types of studies: qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. • In qualitative studies, because of the inductive, evolving methodological design, inquirers may define few terms at the beginning, though may advance tentative definitions. Instead, themes (or perspectives or dimensions) may emerge through the data analysis. In the procedure section, authors define these terms in the procedure section as they surface during the process of research. This approach is to delay the definition of terms until they appear in the study and it makes such definitions difficult
