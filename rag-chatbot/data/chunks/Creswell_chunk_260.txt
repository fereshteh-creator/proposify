context of other, related studies. The ability to frame the study in this way separates novices from more experienced researchers. The veteran has reviewed and understands what has been written about a topic or certain problem in the field. This knowledge comes from years of experience following the development of problems and their accompanying literature. The question often arises as to what type of literature to review. My best advice would be to review research studies in which authors advance research questions and report data to answer them. These studies might be quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods studies. The important point is that the literature provides studies about the research problem being addressed in the proposal. Beginning researchers often ask, “What do I do now? No research has been conducted on my topic.” Of course, in some narrowly construed studies or in new, exploratory projects, no literature exists to document the research problem. Also, it makes sense that a topic is being proposed for study precisely because little research has been conducted on it. To counter this statement, I often suggest that an investigator think about the literature, using an inverted triangle as an image. At the apex of the
