weight is equal between the two methods, but often in practice, priority may be given to one or the other. The mixing during this approach, usually found in an interpretation or discussion section, is to actually merge the data (i.e., transform one type of data to the other type of data so that they can easily be compared) or integrate or compare the results of two databases side by side in a discussion. This side-by-side integration is often seen in published mixed methods studies in which a discussion section first provides quantitative statistical results followed by qualitative quotes that support or disconfirm the quantitative results. --- Seite 197 --- This traditional mixed methods model is advantageous because it is familiar to most researchers and can result in well-validated and substantiated findings. I find that most researchers when they first consider mixed methods employ this model of gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and comparing the two data sources. In addition, the concurrent data collection results in a shorter data collection time period as compared to one of the sequential approaches because both the qualitative and quantitative data are gathered at one time at the research site. This model also has
