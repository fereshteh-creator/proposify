The outline of steps for a survey study began with a discussion about the purpose, the identification of the population and sample, the survey instruments to be used, the relationship between the variables, the research questions, specific items on the survey, and steps to be taken in the analysis and the interpretation of the data from the survey. In the design of an experiment, the researcher identifies participants in the study, the variables—the treatment conditions and the outcome variables—and the instruments used for pre-tests and --- Seite 159 --- post-tests and the materials to be used in the treatments. The design also includes the specific type of experiment, such as a pre-experimental, quasi-experimental, true experiment, or single- subject design. Then the researcher draws a figure to illustrate the design, using appropriate notation. This is followed by comments about potential threats to internal and external validity (and possibly statistical and construct validity) that relate to the experiment, the statistical analysis used to test the hypotheses or research questions, and the interpretation of the results.
