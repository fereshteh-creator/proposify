single question that needed to be answered in the study. It is a broad question stated to permit participants to share diverse perspectives about reading the literature. Example 7.2Qualitative Central Questions From a Case Study Padula and Miller (1999) conducted a multiple case study that described the experiences of women who went back to school, after a time away, in a psychology doctoral program at a major Midwestern research university. The intent was to document the women’s experiences, providing a gendered and feminist perspective for women in the literature. The authors asked three central questions that guided the inquiry: (a) How do women in a psychology doctoral program describe their decision to return to school? (b) How do women in a psychology doctoral program describe their reentry experiences? And (c) How does returning to graduate school change these women’s lives? (Padula & Miller, 1999, p. 328) These three central questions all begin with the word how; they include open-ended verbs, such as “describe,” and they focus on three aspects of the doctoral experience—returning to school, reentering, and changing. They also mention the participants as women in a doctoral program at a Midwestern research university. QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES In
