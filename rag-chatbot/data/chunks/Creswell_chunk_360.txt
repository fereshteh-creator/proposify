can see the actual items used. In an appendix to the proposal, attach sample items or the entire instrument. • Indicate the major content sections in the instrument, such as the cover letter (Dillman, 1978, provides a useful list of items to include in cover letters), the items (e.g., demographics, attitudinal items, behavioral items, factual items), and the closing instructions. Also mention the type of scales used to measure the items on the instrument, such as continuous scales (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree) and categorical scales (e.g., yes/no, rank from highest to lowest importance). • Discuss plans for pilot testing or field testing the survey and provide a rationale for these plans. This testing is important to establish the content validity of an instrument and to improve questions, format, and scales. Indicate the number of people who will test the instrument and the plans to incorporate their comments into final instrument revisions. • For a mailed survey, identify steps for administering the survey and for following up to ensure a high response rate. Salant and Dillman (1994) suggest a four-phase administration process. The first mail-out is a short advance-notice letter to all members of the sample, and the second
