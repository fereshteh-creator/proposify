• Briefly state information about the sample, population, or subjects. • Review key results that relate to the proposed study. • If it is a methodological review (Cooper, 1984), point out technical and methodological flaws in the study. When examining a study to develop a summary, there are places to look for these parts. In well-crafted journal articles, the problem and purpose statements are clearly stated in the introduction. Information about the sample, population, or subjects is found midway through, in a method (or procedure) section, and the results are often reported toward the end. In the results sections, look for passages in which the researchers report information to answer or address each research question or hypothesis. For book-length research studies, look for the same points. Consider the following example: Example 2.1Literature Review in a Quantitative Study Here follows a paragraph summarizing the major components of a quantitative study (Creswell, Seagren, & Henry, 1979), much like the paragraph might appear in a review of the literature section of a dissertation or a journal article. In this passage, I have chosen key components to be abstracted. Creswell, Seagren, and Henry (1979) tested the Biglan model, a three-dimensional model clustering 36 academic
