classification systems drawn from the fields of evaluation, nursing, public health, education policy and research, and social and behavioral research. In these classifications, authors use diverse terms for their types of designs, and a substantial amount of overlap exists in the typologies. For purposes of this discussion I will identify and discuss the six types that my colleagues and I advanced in 2003 (Creswell et al., 2003). Planning Mixed Methods Procedures It is helpful, however, before discussing the six types, to consider several aspects that influence the design of procedures for a mixed methods study. Four important aspects are timing, weighting, mixing, and theorizing (as shown in Figure 10.1). Timing Proposal developers need to consider the timing of their qualitative and quantitative data collection, whether it will be in phases (sequentially) or gathered at the same time --- Seite 191 --- (concurrently). When the data are collected in phases, either the qualitative or the quantitative data can come first. It depends on the initial intent of the researcher. When qualitative data are collected first, the intent is to explore the topic with participants at sites. Then the researcher expands the understanding through a second phase in which data are collected
