research, coordinate the communication among the coders by regular documented meetings and by sharing the analysis. • Cross-check codes developed by different researchers by comparing results that are independently derived. Proposal writers need to include several of these procedures as evidence that they will have consistent results in their proposed study. I recommend that several procedures be mentioned in a proposal and that single researchers find another person who can cross-check their codes, for what I call intercoder agreement (or cross-checking). Such an agreement might be based on whether two or more coders agree on codes used for the same passages in the text (it is not that they code the same passage of text, but whether another coder would code it with the same or a similar code). Statistical procedures or reliability subprograms in qualitative computer software packages can then be used to determine the level of consistency of coding. Miles and Huberman (1994) recommend that the consistency of the coding be in agreement at least 80% of the time for good qualitative reliability. Validity, on the other hand, is one of the strengths of qualitative research, and it is based on determining whether the findings are accurate from
