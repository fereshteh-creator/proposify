in the entire population (Babbie, 1990; Miller, 1991). • Discuss the procedures for selecting the sample from available lists. The most rigorous method for selecting the sample is to choose individuals using a random numbers table, a table available in many introductory statistics texts (e.g., Gravetter & Wallnau, 2000). • Indicate the number of people in the sample and the procedures used to compute this number. In survey research, I recommend that one use a sample size formula available in many survey texts (e.g., see Babbie, 1990; Fowler, 2002). Instrumentation As part of rigorous data collection, the proposal developer also provides detailed information about the actual survey instrument to be used in the proposed study. Consider the following: • Name the survey instrument used to collect data. Discuss whether it is an instrument designed for this research, a modified instrument, or an intact instrument developed by someone else. If it is a modified instrument, indicate whether the developer has provided appropriate permission to use it. In some survey projects, the researcher assembles an instrument from components of several instruments. Again, permission to use any part of other instruments needs to be obtained. In addition, instruments are being increasingly designed for
