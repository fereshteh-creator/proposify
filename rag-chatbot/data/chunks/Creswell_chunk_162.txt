perceived degree of certainty (or probability) that a causal relationship generally exists between behavior and rewards. This construct of generalized expectancy has been defined as internal locus of control when an individual believes that reinforcements are a function of specific behavior, or as external locus of control when the effects are attributed to luck, fate, or powerful others. The perceptions of causal relationships need not be absolute positions, but rather tend to vary in degree along a continuum depending upon previous experiences and situational complexities (Rotter, 1966). [Author explains variables in the theory.] In the application of social learning theory to this study of scholarly productivity, the four classes of variables identified by Rotter (1954) will be defined in the following manner. 1. Scholarly productivity is the desired behavior or activity. 2. Locus of control is the generalized expectancy that rewards are or are not dependent upon specific behaviors. 3. Reinforcements are the rewards from scholarly work and the value attached to these rewards. 4. The educational institution is the psychological situation which furnishes many of the rewards for scholarly productivity. With these specific variables, the formula for behavior which was developed by Rotter (1975) would be adapted to read:
