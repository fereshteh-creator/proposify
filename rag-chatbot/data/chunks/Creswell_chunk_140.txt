as patterns, theoretical lens, or naturalistic generalizations, to describe the broader explanations used or developed in their studies. Examples in this chapter illustrate the alternatives available to qualitative researchers. Finally, the chapter turns to the use of theories in mixed methods research and the use of a transformative perspective that is popular in this approach. QUANTITATIVE THEORY USE Variables in Quantitative Research Before discussing quantitative theories, it is important to understand variables and the types that are used in forming theories. A variable refers to a characteristic or attribute of an individual or an organization that can be measured or observed and that varies among the people or organization being studied (Creswell, 2007a).
