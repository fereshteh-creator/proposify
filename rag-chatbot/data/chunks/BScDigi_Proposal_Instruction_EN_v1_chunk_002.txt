planning phase. • A proposal provides a framework for the student to work on. Benefits for the BT A proposal should: • increase the quality of the BT • standardize the requirements (e.g., theory and empirical part obligatory) • enable students to use their time efficiently • give students confidence that they are on the right track. Criteria A good proposal should meet the following criteria: • There is a connection ("red line") between the background, objectives/questions, theory, method, and expected results. • The objectives and expected results seem realistic. The emergence of the results is evident from the application of the theoretical concepts and the method. • Introduction: The background, objectives/questions, and the relevance are clear, understandable, and delimited • Theoretical concept and method: The selection of the theoretical concept and the method is justified and appropriate to meet the objectives/answer the questions. • Structure: The thesis's structure and composition are comprehensible and aligned with the method. • The student is ready for the next step of the work, namely, to design and implement a theory-based method (e.g., survey questionnaire or interview guideline) in which the reference to theory and the research question is evident.
