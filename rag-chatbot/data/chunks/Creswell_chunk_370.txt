discussed the instrument.] Concurrent and convergent validity (Campbell & Fiske, 1959) of these measures was established through factor analysis, and was found to be at an adequate level. Reliability of the factors was established through the coefficient alpha. The constructs were represented by 25 measures—multiple items combined on the basis of factor analysis to make indices—and 27 measures were single item indicators. [Validity and reliability were addressed.] Multiple regression and path analysis (Heise, 1969; Kerlinger & Pedhazur, 1973) were used to analyze the data. --- Seite 146 --- In the causal model . . . , intent to leave was regressed on all variables which preceded it in the causal sequence. Intervening variables significantly related to intent to leave were then regressed on organizational variables, personal variables, environmental variables, and background variables. [Data analysis steps were presented.] COMPONENTS OF AN EXPERIMENTAL METHOD PLAN An experimental method discussion follows a standard form: participants, materials, procedures, and measures. These four topics generally are sufficient. In this section of the chapter, I review these components as well as information about the experimental design and statistical analysis. As with the section on surveys, the intent here is to highlight key topics to be addressed
