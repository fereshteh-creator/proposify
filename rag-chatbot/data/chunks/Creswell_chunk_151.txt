some respects both their activities and their sentiments tend to become. (pp. 112, 118, 120) Third, an author may present a theory as a visual model. It is useful to translate variables into a visual picture. Blalock (1969, 1985, 1991) advocates causal modeling and recasts verbal theories into causal models so that a reader can visualize the interconnections of variables. Two simplified examples are presented here. As shown in Figure 3.1, three independent variables influence a single dependent variable, mediated by the influence of two intervening variables. A diagram such as this one shows the possible causal sequence among variables leading to modeling through path analysis and more advanced analyses using multiple measures of variables as found in structural equation modeling (see Kline, 1998). At an introductory level, Duncan (1985) provides useful suggestions about the notation for constructing these visual causal diagrams: Figure 3.1 Three Independent Variables Influence a Single Dependent Variable Mediated by Two Intervening Variables --- Seite 63 --- • Position the dependent variables on the right in the diagram and the independent variables on the left. • Use one-way arrows leading from each determining variable to each variable dependent on it. • Indicate the strength of the
