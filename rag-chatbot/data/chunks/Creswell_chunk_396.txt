reviewed a set of instructions for viewing the videotape. The first half of the sample was randomly assigned to one of the twelve videotapes (3 Approaches X 2 Statements X 2 Counselors), and a median was obtained on the ATF.

The median on the final sample was checked and a few participants recategorized by the final median split, which resulted in 12 or 13 participants per cell. After viewing the videotape that corresponded to their experimental assignment, participants completed the dependent measures and were debriefed.
