of a proposal learn about the variables in purpose statements and research questions/hypotheses sections, it is useful in the method section to relate the variables to the --- Seite 142 --- specific questions or hypotheses on the instrument. One technique is to relate the variables, the research questions or hypotheses, and items on the survey instrument so that a reader can easily determine how the researcher will use the questionnaire items.

This procedure is especially helpful in dissertations in which investigators test large-scale models. Table 8.2 illustrates such a table using hypothetical data. Table 8.2 Variables, Research Questions, and Items on a Survey Data Analysis and Interpretation In the proposal, present information about the steps involved in analyzing the data. I recommend the following research tips, presenting them as a series of steps so that a reader can see how one step leads to another for a complete discussion of the data analysis procedures. Step 1. Report information about the number of members of the sample who did and did not return the survey. A table with numbers and percentages
