and specific t-test and regression results. In contrast, they devote one page to the qualitative data analysis and note briefly the themes that occurred in the discussion. The weight in this mixed methods study was assigned to quantitative data collection and analysis, and the notation for the study would be QUAN + qual. The mixing of the two data sources occurred in a section titled “Discussion of Survey and Interview Results” (p. 155), at the interpretation stage of the research process. In this section, they compared the importance of the factors explaining parental savings for the quantitative results, on one hand, with the findings from the interview data on the other. Similar to Example 10.1, no theoretical lens guided the study, although the article began with the literature on econometric studies and research on college choice and ended with an “Augmented Model of Parental Savings.” Thus, we might characterize the use of theory in this study as inductive (as in qualitative inquiry), drawn from the literature (as in quantitative research), and ultimately as generated during the process of research. Example 10.3A Transformative Strategy of Inquiry A feminist lens was used in a transformative triangulation mixed methods study by Bhopal (2000).
