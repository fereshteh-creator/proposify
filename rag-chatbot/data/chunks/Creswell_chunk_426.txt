information? Sometimes qualitative researchers write notes in margins or start recording general thoughts about the data at this stage. Step 3. Begin detailed analysis with a coding process. Coding is the process of organizing the material into chunks or segments of text before bringing meaning to information (Rossman & Rallis, 1998, p. 171). It involves taking text data or pictures gathered during data collection, segmenting sentences (or paragraphs) or images into categories, and labeling those categories with a term, often a term based in the actual language of the participant (called an in vivo term). Before proceeding to Step 4, consider some remarks that will provide detailed guidance for the coding process. Tesch (1990, pp. 142-145) provides a useful analysis of the process in eight steps: 1. Get a sense of the whole. Read all the transcriptions carefully. Perhaps jot down some ideas as they come to mind. 2. Pick one document (i.e., one interview)—the most interesting one, the shortest, the one on the top of the pile.
