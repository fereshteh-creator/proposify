inadequate or not available. Using a three-phase approach, the researcher first gathers qualitative data and analyzes it (Phase 1), and uses the analysis to development an instrument (Phase 2) that is subsequently administered to a sample of a population (Phase 3; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). The sequential exploratory strategy has many of the same advantages as the sequential explanatory model. Its two-phase approach (qualitative research followed by quantitative research) makes it easy to implement and straightforward to describe and report. It is useful to a researcher who wants to explore a phenomenon but also wants to expand on the qualitative findings. This model is especially advantageous when a researcher is building a new instrument. In addition, this model could make a largely qualitative study more palatable to an adviser, committee, or research community well versed in quantitative research and that may be unfamiliar with the qualitative approaches. As with the sequential explanatory approach, the sequential exploratory model requires a substantial length of time to complete both data collection phases, which can be a drawback for some research situations. In addition, the researcher has to make some key decisions about which findings from the initial qualitative phase will be focused
