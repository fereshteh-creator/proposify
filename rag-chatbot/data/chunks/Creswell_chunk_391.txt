increasing frequency, experimental researchers report both statistical results of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals and effect size as indicators of practical significance of the findings. A confidence interval is an interval estimate of the range of upper and lower statistical values that are consistent with the observed data and are likely to contain the actual population mean. An effect size identifies the strength of the conclusions about group differences or the relationships among variables in quantitative studies. The calculation of effect size varies for different statistical tests. Interpreting Results The final step in an experiment is to interpret the findings in light of the hypotheses or research questions set forth in the beginning. In this interpretation, address whether the hypotheses or questions were supported or whether they were refuted. Consider whether the treatment that was implemented actually made a difference for the participants who experienced them. Suggest why or why not the results were significant, drawing on past literature that you reviewed (Chapter 2), the theory used in the study (Chapter 3), or persuasive logic that might explain the results. Address whether the results might have occurred because of inadequate experimental procedures, such as threats to internal validity, and indicate
