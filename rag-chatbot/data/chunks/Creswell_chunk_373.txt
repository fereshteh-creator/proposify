1991). • Identify other features in the experimental design that will systematically control the variables that might influence the outcome. One approach is matching participants in terms of a certain trait or characteristic and then assigning one individual from each matched set to each group. For example, scores on a pre-test might be obtained. Individuals might then be assigned to groups, with each group having the same numbers of high, medium, and low scorers on the pre-test. Alternatively, the criteria for matching might be ability levels or demographic variables. Table 8.4 A Checklist of Questions for Designing an Experimental Procedure --- Seite 147 --- A researcher may decide not to match, however, because it is expensive, takes time (Salkind, 1990), and leads to incomparable groups if participants leave the experiment (Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991). Other procedures to place control into experiments involve using covariates (e.g., pre-test scores) as moderating variables and controlling for their effects statistically, selecting homogeneous samples, or blocking the participants into subgroups or categories and analyzing the impact of each subgroup on the outcome (Creswell, 2008). • Tell the reader about the number of participants in each group and the systematic procedures for determining the size of
