A proposal provides detailed information about the background, the problem, the objective, and the means (theoretical and methodological) used to achieve it. Locke, Spirduso and Silverman1 distinguish three essential functions of a proposal: • A proposal provides the supervisor with information about the goals ("Doing the Right Thing") and means ("Doing the Thing Right") that the student intends to use to achieve them. • A proposal is a plan describing how the work will be organized. A piece of work can only be as good as its basic design allows. Late sparks of inspiration cannot usually save what has been overlooked in the planning phase. • A proposal provides a framework for the student to work on. Benefits for the BT A proposal should: • increase the quality of the BT • standardize the requirements (e.g., theory and empirical part obligatory) • enable students to use their time efficiently • give students confidence
