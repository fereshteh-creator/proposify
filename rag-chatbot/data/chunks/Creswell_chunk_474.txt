Methods, while numerous others actively encourage this form of inquiry (e.g., International Journal of Social Research Methodology, Qualitative Health Research, Annals of Family Medicine). Numerous published research studies have incorporated mixed methods research in the social and human sciences in diverse fields such as occupational therapy (Lysack & Krefting, 1994), interpersonal communication (Boneva, Kraut, & Frohlich, 2001), AIDS prevention (Janz et al., 1996), dementia caregiving (Weitzman & Levkoff, 2000), mental health (Rogers, Day, Randall, & Bentall, 2003), and in middle-school science (Houtz, 1995). New books arrive each year solely devoted to mixed methods research (Bryman, 2006; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Greene, 2007; Plano Clark & Creswell, 2008; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). A checklist of questions for designing a mixed methods study appears in Table 10.1. These components call for advancing the nature of mixed methods research and the type of strategy being proposed for the study. They also include the need for a visual model of this approach, the specific procedures of data collection and analysis, the researcher’s role, and the structure for presenting the final report. Following the discussion of each of these components, an --- Seite 189 --- example of a procedures section from a mixed methods
