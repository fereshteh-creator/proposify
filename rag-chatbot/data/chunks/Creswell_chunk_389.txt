of each pair to the experimental group and the other member to the control group. 4. Expose the experimental group to the experimental treatment and administer no treatment or an alternative treatment to the control group. 5. Administer measures of the dependent variables to the experimental and control groups. --- Seite 156 --- 6. Compare the performance of the experimental and control groups on the post-test(s) using tests of statistical significance. Data Analysis Tell the reader about the types of statistical analysis that will be used during the experiment. • Report the descriptive statistics calculated for observations and measures at the pre-test or post-test stage of experimental designs. These statistics are means, standard deviations, and ranges. • Indicate the inferential statistical tests used to examine the hypotheses in the study. For experimental designs with categorical information (groups) on the independent variable and continuous information on the dependent variable, researchers use t tests or univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), or multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA—multiple dependent measures). (Several of these tests are mentioned in Table 8.3, presented earlier.) In factorial designs, both interaction and main effects of ANOVA are used. When data on a pre-test or post-test
