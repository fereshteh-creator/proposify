structured record reviews to collect financial, medical, or school information; and structured observations. The data collection may also involve creating a Web- based or Internet survey and administering it online (Nesbary, 2000; Sue & Ritter, 2007). Regardless of the form of data collection, provide a rationale for the procedure, using arguments based on its strengths and weaknesses, costs, data availability, and convenience. Table 8.1 A Checklist of Questions for Designing a Survey Method --- Seite 139 --- The Population and Sample Specify the characteristics of the population and the sampling procedure. Methodologists have written excellent discussions about the underlying logic of sampling theory (e.g., Babbie, 1990, 2007). Here are essential aspects of the population and sample to describe in a research plan: • Identify the population in the study. Also state the size of this population, if size can be determined, and the means of identifying individuals in the population. Questions of access arise here, and the researcher might refer to availability of sampling frames—mail or published lists—of potential respondents in the population. • Identify whether the sampling design for this population is single stage or multistage (called clustering). Cluster sampling is ideal when it is impossible or impractical to
