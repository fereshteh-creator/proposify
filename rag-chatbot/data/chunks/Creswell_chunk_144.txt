need to be “controlled” so that the true influence of the independent variable on the dependent can be determined. Another type of variable, a confounding (or spurious) variable, is not actually measured or observed in a study. It exists, but its influence cannot be directly detected. Researchers comment on the influence of confounding variables after the study has been completed, because these variables may have operated to explain the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable, but they were not or could not be easily assessed (e.g., discriminatory attitudes). In a quantitative research study, variables are related to answer a research question (e.g., “How does self-esteem influence the formation of friendships among adolescents?”) or to make predictions about what the researcher expects the results to show. These predictions are called hypotheses (e.g., “Individual positive self-esteem expands the number of friends of adolescents.”) Definition of a Theory With this background on variables, we can proceed to the use of quantitative theories. In quantitative research, some historical precedent exists for viewing a theory as a scientific prediction or explanation (see G. Thomas, 1997, for different ways of conceptualizing theories and how they might constrain thought). For example, Kerlinger’s (1979) definition of
