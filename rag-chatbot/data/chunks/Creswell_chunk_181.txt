Transformative-Emancipatory Perspective,” in A. Tashakkori & C. Teddlie (Eds.), Handbook of Mixed Methods in the Social & Behavioral Sciences. Adapted with permission.

Consistent with a transformative-emancipatory framework, they examined the language of participants with HIV/AIDS within the participants’ social context. They first conducted 75 open-ended ethnographic interviews to identify “language themes” (p. 31), such as blame, ownership, and acceptance or nonacceptance. They also collected 40 semistructured interviews that addressed demographics, daily routine, drug use, knowledge of HIV/AIDS risks, and drug and sexual socio-behavioral characteristics.

The design in this study gave “primacy to the value-based and action-oriented dimensions of different inquiry traditions” (Greene & Caracelli, 1997, p. 24) in a mixed methods study. The authors used a theoretical lens for reconfiguring the language and dialogue of participants, and they
