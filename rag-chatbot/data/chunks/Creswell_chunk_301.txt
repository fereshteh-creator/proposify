methods purpose statement scripts follow (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). The first two are sequential studies with one type of data collection building on the other; the third is a concurrent study with both types of data collected at the same time and brought together in data analysis. The fourth example is a transformative mixed methods study script also based on a concurrent design. 1. A sequential study with a second quantitative phase building on an initial first qualitative phase: The intent of this two-phase, sequential mixed methods study is to ___________ (mention content objective of the study). The first phase will be a qualitative exploration of a ___________ (central phenomenon) by collecting ___________ (types of data) from ___________ (participants) at ___________ (research site). Findings from this qualitative phase will then be used to test ___________ (a theory, research questions, or hypotheses) that ___________ (relate, compare) ___________ (independent variable) with ___________ (dependent variable) for ___________ (sample of population) at ___________ (research site). The reason for collecting qualitative data initially is that ___________ (e.g., instruments are inadequate or not available, variables are not known, there is little guiding theory or few taxonomies). 2. A sequential study with the qualitative follow-up phase
