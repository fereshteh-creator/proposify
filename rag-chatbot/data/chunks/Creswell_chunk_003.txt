SUMMARY ADDITIONAL READINGS Glossary References Author Index Subject Index --- Seite 5 --- I dedicate this book to Karen Drumm Creswell. She is the inspiration for my writing and my life. Because of her, as wife, supporter, and detailed and careful editor, I am able to work long hours and keep the home fires burning during the years that I devote to my job and my books. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being there for me. --- Seite 6 --- --- Seite 7 --- --- Seite 8 --- Copyright © 2009 by SAGE Publications, Inc. All rights reserved.
