language will need to be used. In this case, provide a definition and use the term consistently throughout the plan and the study (Wilkinson, 1991). • Researchers might define terms so that they accomplish different goals. A definition may describe a common language word (e.g., organization). It may also be paired with a limitation, such as, “The curriculum will be limited to those after school activities that the current School District Manual lists as approved for secondary school students” (Locke et al., 2007, p. 130). It may establish a criterion that will be used in the study, such as, “High grade point average means a cumulative GPA of 3.7 or above on a 4.0 scale.” It could also define a term operationally, such as, “Reinforcement will refer to the procedure of listing all club members in the school newspaper, providing special hall passes for members, and listing club memberships on school transcripts” (Locke et al., 2007, p. 130). • Although no one format exists for defining terms, one approach is to develop a separate section, called the “Definition of Terms,” and clearly set off the terms and their definitions by highlighting the term. In this way, the word is assigned
