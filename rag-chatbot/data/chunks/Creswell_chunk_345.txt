questions, or writing both quantitative questions or hypotheses and qualitative questions followed by a mixed methods question, or writing only a mixed methods question. Writing Exercises 1. For a qualitative study, write one or two central questions followed by five to seven subquestions. 2. For a quantitative study, write two sets of questions. The first set should be descriptive questions about the independent and dependent variables in the study. The second set should pose questions that relate (or compare) the independent variable(s) with the dependent variable(s). This follows the model presented in this chapter for combining descriptive and inferential questions. 3. Write a mixed methods research question. Write it first as a question incorporating the procedures of your mixed methods study and then rewrite it to incorporate the content. Comment on which approach works best for you.

In this chapter, I discuss the nine steps in conducting a mixed methods study. These are as follows: 1. Determine if a mixed methods study is needed to study the problem; 2. Consider whether a mixed methods
