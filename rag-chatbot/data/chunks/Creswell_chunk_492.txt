the sequential explanatory approach, the sequential exploratory model requires a substantial length of time to complete both data collection phases, which can be a drawback for some research situations. In addition, the researcher has to make some key decisions about which findings from the initial qualitative phase will be focused on in the subsequent quantitative phase (e.g., one theme, comparisons among groups, multiple themes). Sequential Transformative Strategy This final sequential approach has two distinct data collection phases, one following the other as in the first two strategies described (see Figure 10.2c). The sequential transformative strategy is a two-phase project with a theoretical lens (e.g., gender, race, social science theory) --- Seite 196 --- overlaying the sequential procedures. It too has an initial phase (either quantitative or qualitative) followed by a second phase (either qualitative or quantitative) that builds on the earlier phase. The theoretical lens is introduced in the introduction to a proposal, shapes a directional research question aimed at exploring a problem (e.g., inequality, discrimination, injustice), creates sensitivity to collecting data from marginalized or underrepresented groups, and ends with a call for action. In this design the researcher may use either method in the first phase of research, and
