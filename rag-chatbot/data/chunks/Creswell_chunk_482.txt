occur. How the data are mixed has received considerable recent attention (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). Mixing means either that the qualitative and quantitative data are actually merged on one end of the continuum, kept separate on the other end of the continuum, or combined in some way between these two extremes. The two data bases might be kept separate but connected; for example, in a two-phase project that begins with a quantitative phase, the analysis of the data and its results can be used to identify participants for qualitative data collection in a follow-up phase. In this situation, the quantitative and qualitative data are connected during the phases of research. Connected in mixed methods research means a mixing of the quantitative and qualitative research are connected between a data analysis of the first phase of research and the data collection of the second phase of research. In another study, the researcher might collect both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and integrate or merge the two databases by transforming the qualitative themes into counts and comparing these counts with descriptive quantitative data. In this case, the mixing consists of integrating the two databases by actually merging the quantitative data with
