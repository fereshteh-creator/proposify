This procedure can involve conducting a follow-up interview with participants in the study and providing an opportunity for them to comment on the findings. • Use rich, thick description to convey the findings. This description may transport readers to the setting and give the discussion an element of shared experiences. When qualitative researchers provide detailed descriptions of the setting, for example, or provide many perspectives about a theme, the results become more realistic and richer.
