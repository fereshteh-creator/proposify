In response, educators and others have advanced educational arguments supporting affirmative action, claiming that a diverse student body is more educationally effective than a more homogeneous one. Harvard University President Neil Rudenstine claims that the “fundamental rationale for student diversity in higher education [is] its educational value” (Rudenstine, 1999, p. 1). Lee Bollinger, Rudenstine’s counterpart at the University of Michigan, has asserted, “A classroom that does not have a significant representation from members of different races produces an impoverished discussion” (Schmidt, 1998, p. A32). These two presidents are not alone in their beliefs. A statement published by the Association of American Universities and endorsed by the presidents of 62 research universities stated: “We speak first and foremost as educators. We believe that our students benefit significantly from education that takes place within a diverse setting” (“On the Importance of Diversity in University Admissions,” The New York Times, April 24, 1997, p.
