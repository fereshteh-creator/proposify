qualitative and quantitative methods to address the same research problem leads to issues of weighing each method and their sequence in a study. Based on these ideas, she then advances two forms of methodological triangulation: simultaneous, using both methods at the same time; and sequential, using the results of one method for planning the next method. These two forms are described using a notation of capital and lowercase letters that signify relative weight as well as sequence. The different approaches to triangulation are then discussed in the light of their purpose, limitations, and approaches. Tashakkori, A., & Teddlie, C. (Eds.). (2003). Handbook of mixed methods in the social & behavioral sciences. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. This handbook, edited by Abbas Tashakkori and Charles Teddlie, represents the most substantial effort to date to bring together the leading writers about mixed methods research. In 27 chapters, it introduces the reader to mixed methods, illustrates methodological and analytic issues in its use, identifies applications in the social and human sciences, and plots future directions. For example, separate chapters illustrate the use of mixed methods research in evaluation, management and organization, health sciences, nursing, psychology, sociology, and education. --- Seite 207 --- Glossary Abstract
