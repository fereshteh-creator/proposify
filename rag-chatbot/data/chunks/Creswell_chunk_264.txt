For example, because past studies have overlooked an important variable, a study will include it and analyze its effect: For instance, because past studies have overlooked the examination of Native Americans as a cultural group, a study will include them as the participants in the project. In the two examples that follow, the authors point out the gaps or shortcomings of the literature. Notice their use of key phrases to indicate the shortcomings: “what remains to be explored,” “little empirical research,” and “very few studies.” Example 5.1 Deficiencies in the Literature—Needed Studies For this reason, the meaning of war and peace has been explored extensively by social scientists (Cooper, 1965; Alvik, 1968; Rosell, 1968; Svancarova & Svancarova, 1967-68; Haavedsrud, 1970).
