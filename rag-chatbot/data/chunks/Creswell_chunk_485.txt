research process in mixed methods research. Alternative Strategies and Visual Models These four factors—timing, weight, mixing, and theorizing—help to shape the procedures of a mixed methods study. Although these do not exhaust all the possibilities, there are six major strategies for inquirers to choose from in designing a research proposal; they are adapted from Creswell et al. (2003). A proposal would contain a description of the strategy and a visual model of it, as well as basic procedures that the investigator will use in implementing the strategy. Each strategy is briefly described and illustrated in Figures 10.2 and 10.3. The words qualitative --- Seite 193 --- and quantitative have been shortened in the figures to read “qual” and “quan,” respectively (see the discussion following the figures). These mixed methods strategies can be described using notation that has developed in the mixed methods field. Mixed methods notation provides shorthand labels and symbols that convey important aspects of mixed methods research, and it provides a way that mixed methods researchers can easily communicate their procedures. The following notation is adapted from Morse (1991), Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998), and Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) who suggest the following: • A “+” indicates a
