both ideas and people. These various approaches have been used to examine the effects of diversity on a broad array of student educational outcomes. The evidence is almost uniformly consistent in indicating that students in a racial/ethnically or gender-diverse community, or engaged in a diversity-related activity, reap a wide array of positive educational benefits. [Authors mention studies that have addressed the problem.] Only a relative handful of studies (e.g., Chang, 1996, 1999a; Sax, 1996) have specifically examined whether the racial/ethnic or gender composition of the students on a campus, in an academic major, or in a classroom (i.e., structural diversity) has the educational benefits claimed . . . . Whether the degree of racial diversity of a campus or classroom has a direct effect --- Seite 105 --- on learning outcomes, however, remains an open question. [Deficiencies in the studies are noted.] The scarcity of information on the educational benefits of the structural diversity on a campus or in its classrooms is regrettable because it is the sort of evidence the courts appear to be requiring if they are to support race-sensitive admissions policies. [Importance of the study for an audience mentioned.] This study attempted to contribute to the knowledge
