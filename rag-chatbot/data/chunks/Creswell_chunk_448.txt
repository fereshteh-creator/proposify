descriptions and themes that convey multiple perspectives from participants and detailed descriptions of the setting or individuals. Using a qualitative strategy of inquiry, these results may also provide a chronological narrative of an individual’s life (narrative research), a detailed description of their experiences (phenomenology), a theory generated from the data (grounded theory), a detailed portrait of a culture-sharing group (ethnography), or an in-depth analysis of one or more cases (case study). Given these different strategies, the findings and interpretation sections of a plan for a study might discuss how the sections will be presented: as objective accounts, fieldwork experiences (Van Maanen, 1988), a chronology, a process model, an extended story, an analysis by cases or across cases, or a detailed descriptive portrait (Creswell, 2007). At the specific level, some writing strategies might be as follows: • Use quotes and vary their length from short to long embedded passages. • Script conversation and report the conversation in different languages to reflect cultural sensitivity. • Present text information in tabular form (e.g., matrices, comparison tables of different codes). • Use the wording from participants to form codes and theme labels. • Intertwine quotations with (the author’s) interpretations. • Use indents or other
