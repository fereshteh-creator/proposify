by providing a specific treatment to one group and withholding it from another and then determining how both groups scored on an outcome. Experiments include true experiments, with the random assignment of subjects to treatment conditions, and quasi- experiments that use nonrandomized designs (Keppel, 1991). Included within quasi- experiments are single-subject designs. Qualitative Strategies In qualitative research, the numbers and types of approaches have also become more clearly visible during the 1990s and into the 21st century. Books have summarized the various types (such as the 19 strategies identified by Wolcott, 2001), and complete procedures are now available on specific qualitative inquiry approaches. For example, Clandinin and Connelly (2000) constructed a picture of what narrative researchers do. Moustakas (1994) discussed the philosophical tenets and the procedures of the phenomenological method, and Strauss and --- Seite 30 --- Corbin (1990, 1998) identified the procedures of grounded theory. Wolcott (1999) summarized ethnographic procedures, and Stake (1995) suggested processes involved in case study research. In this book, illustrations are drawn from the following strategies, recognizing that approaches such as participatory action research (Kemmis & Wilkinson, 1998), discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004), and others not mentioned (see Creswell, 2007b) are also viable ways to conduct
