field multiple times for data collection. Weighting A second factor that goes into designing procedures is the weight or priority given to quantitative or qualitative research in a particular study. In some studies, the weight might be equal; in other studies, it might emphasize one or the other. A priority for one type depends on the interests of the researcher, the audience for the study (e.g., faculty committee, professional association), and what the investigator seeks to emphasize in the study. In practical terms, weight occurs in a mixed methods study through such strategies as whether quantitative or qualitative information is emphasized first, the extent of treatment of one type of data or the other in the project, or the use of primarily an inductive approach (i.e., generating themes in qualitative) or a deductive approach (i.e., testing a theory). Sometimes the researcher intentionally uses one form of data in a supportive role to a larger study, as is found in some experimental trials (see Rogers et al., 2003).
