Third, acknowledge participants in a study (e.g., rather than “subject,” use the word “participant,” and rather than “woman doctor” use “doctor” or “physician”). • Other ethical issues in writing the research will involve the potential of suppressing, falsifying, or inventing findings to meet a researcher’s or an audience’s needs. These fraudulent practices are not accepted in professional research communities, and they constitute scientific misconduct (Neuman, 2000). A proposal might contain a proactive stance by the researcher to not engage in these practices. • In planning a study, it is important to anticipate the repercussions of conducting the research on certain audiences and not to misuse the results to the advantage of one group or another. The researcher needs to provide those at the research site with a preliminary copy of any publications from the research (Creswell, 2007). • An important issue in writing a scholarly manuscript is to not exploit the labor of colleagues and to provide authorship to individuals who substantially contribute to publications.
