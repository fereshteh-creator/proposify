66) Third, distinct from this theoretical orientation are qualitative studies in which theory (or some other broad explanation) becomes the end point. It is an inductive process of building from the data to broad themes to a generalized model or theory (see Punch, 2005). The logic of this inductive approach is shown in Figure 3.5. Figure 3.5 The Inductive Logic of Research in a Qualitative Study The researcher begins by gathering detailed information from participants and then forms this information into categories or themes. These themes are developed into broad patterns, --- Seite 72 --- theories, or generalizations that are then compared with personal experiences or with existing literature on the topic. The development of themes and categories into patterns, theories, or generalizations suggests varied end points for qualitative studies. For example, in case study research, Stake (1995) refers to an assertion as a propositional generalization—the researcher’s summary of interpretations and claims—to which is added the researcher’s own personal experiences, called “naturalistic generalizations” (p. 86). As another example, grounded theory provides a different end point. Inquirers hope to discover a theory that is grounded in information from participants (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Lincoln and Guba (1985) refer to “pattern theories”
