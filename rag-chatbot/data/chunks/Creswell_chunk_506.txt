quantitative results. • Study published articles that use different approaches and determine which one makes the most sense to you. Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) include four complete journal articles so that readers can examine the detail of studies employing different forms of designs. • Find a published mixed methods journal article that uses your design and introduce it to your adviser and faculty committee so that they have a working model for the approach you plan to use in your study. Since we are at the early stage of adopting mixed methods research in many fields, a published example of research in your field will help to create both legitimacy for mixed methods research and the idea that it is a feasible approach to research for graduate committees or other audiences.
