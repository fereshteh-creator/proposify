parent data from a longitudinal study employing multiple surveys over a three-year period, logistic regression was used to identify the factors most strongly associated with parental saving for postsecondary education. In addition, insights gained from the interviews of a small sub-sample of students and parents who were interviewed five times during the three-year period are used to further examine parental savings. (Hossler & Vesper, 1993, p. 141) The actual data was collected from 182 student and parent participants from surveys over a 4- year period of time and from 56 students and their parents in interviews. From the purpose statement, we can see that they collected data concurrently as an implementation strategy. They provide extensive discussion of the quantitative analysis of the survey data, including a discussion about the measurement of variables and the details of the logistic regression data analysis. They also mention the limitations of the quantitative analysis and specific t-test and regression results. In contrast, they devote one page to the qualitative data analysis and note briefly the themes that occurred in the discussion. The weight in this mixed methods study was assigned to quantitative data collection and analysis, and the notation for the study would be
