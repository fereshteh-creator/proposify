the qualitative or the quantitative data can come first. It depends on the initial intent of the researcher. When qualitative data are collected first, the intent is to explore the topic with participants at sites. Then the researcher expands the understanding through a second phase in which data are collected from a large number of people (typically a sample representative of a population). When data are collected concurrently, both quantitative and qualitative data are gathered at the same time and the implementation is simultaneous. In many projects it may be unworkable to collect data over an expanded time period (e.g., in the health sciences when busy medical personnel have limited time for data collection in the field). In this case, it is more manageable to collect both quantitative and qualitative data at roughly the same time, when the researcher(s) is in the field collecting data, rather than to revisit the field multiple times for data collection. Weighting A second factor that goes into designing procedures is the weight or priority given to quantitative or qualitative research in a particular study. In some studies, the weight might be equal; in other studies, it might emphasize one or the other. A priority
