feminist lens. SUMMARY In designing the procedures for a mixed methods study, begin by conveying the nature of mixed methods research. This includes tracing its history, defining it, and mentioning its applications in many fields of research. Then, state and employ four criteria to select an appropriate mixed methods strategy. Indicate the timing strategy for data collection (concurrent or sequential). Also state weight or priority given to the quantitative or qualitative approach, such as equal weight, or a priority to quantitative or qualitative data. Mention how the data will be mixed, such as through merging the data, connecting the data from one phase to another, or embedding a secondary source of data into a larger, primary source. Finally, identify whether a theoretical lens or framework will guide the study, such as a theory from the social sciences or a lens from an advocacy perspective (e.g., feminism, racial perspective). Six strategies are organized around whether the data are collected sequentially (explanatory and exploratory), concurrently (triangulation and nested), or with a transformative lens (sequential or concurrent). Each model has strengths and weaknesses, although the sequential approach is the easiest to implement. Choice of strategy also can be presented in a figure in
