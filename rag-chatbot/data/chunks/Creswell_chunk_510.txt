occurs both within the quantitative (descriptive and inferential numeric analysis) and the qualitative (description and thematic text or image analysis) approach and often between the two approaches. For example, some of the more popular mixed methods data analysis approaches are the following (see Caracelli & Greene, 1993; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998): • Data transformation: In the concurrent strategies, a researcher may quantify the qualitative data. This involves creating codes and themes qualitatively, then counting the number of times they occur in the text data (or possibly the extent of talk about a code or theme by counting lines or sentences). This quantification of qualitative data then enables a researcher to compare quantitative results with the qualitative data. Alternatively, an inquirer may qualify quantitative data. For instance, in a factor analysis of data from a scale on an instrument, the researcher may create factors or themes that then can be compared with themes from the qualitative database. • Explore outliers: In a sequential model, an analysis of quantitative data in the first phase can yield extreme or outlier cases. Follow-up qualitative interviews with these outlier cases can provide insight about why they diverged from the quantitative
