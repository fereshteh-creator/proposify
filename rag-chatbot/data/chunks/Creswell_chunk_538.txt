engage in research. This form acknowledges that participants’ rights will be protected during data collection. Integrating the two databases in mixed methods research means that the quantitative and qualitative databases are actually merged through a comparison approach or through data transformation. Intercoder agreement (or cross-checking) is when two or more coders agree on codes used for the same passages in the text. (It is not that they code the same text, but whether another coder would code a similar passage with the same or a similar code). Statistical procedures or reliability subprograms in qualitative computer software packages can be used to determine the level of consistency of coding. Internal validity threats are experimental procedures, treatments, or experiences of the participants that threaten the researcher’s ability to draw correct inferences from the data about the population in an experiment. Interpretation of the results in quantitative research means that the researcher draws conclusions from the results for the research questions, hypotheses, and the larger meaning of the results. Interpretation in qualitative research means that the researcher draws meaning from the findings of data analysis. This meaning may result in lessons learned, information to compare with the literature, or personal experiences. Interview protocol
