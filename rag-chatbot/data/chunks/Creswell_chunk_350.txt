1979), as well as some newer texts, extend the ideas presented here (e.g., Bausell, 1994; Boruch, 1998; Field & Hole, 2003; Keppel, 1991; Lipsey, 1990; Reichardt & Mark, 1998). In this chapter, the focus is on the essential components of a method section in proposals for a survey and an experiment. DEFINING SURVEYS AND EXPERIMENTS A survey design provides a quantitative or numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a population by studying a sample of that population. From sample results, the researcher generalizes or makes claims about the population. In an experiment, investigators may also identify a sample and generalize to a population; however, the basic intent of an experimental design is to test the impact of a treatment (or an intervention) on an outcome, controlling for all other factors that might influence that outcome. As one form of control, researchers randomly assign individuals to groups. When one group receives a treatment and the other group does not, the experimenter can isolate whether it is the treatment and not other factors that influence the outcome. COMPONENTS OF A SURVEY METHOD PLAN The design of a survey method section follows a standard format. Numerous examples of this format appear
