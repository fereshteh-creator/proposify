in the first phase will be the focus of the second phase. Concurrent Triangulation Strategy The concurrent triangulation approach is probably the most familiar of the six major mixed methods models (see Figure 10.3a). In a concurrent triangulation approach, the researcher collects both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and then compares the two databases to determine if there is convergence, differences, or some combination. Some authors refer to this comparison as confirmation, disconfirmation, cross-validation, or corroboration (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989; Morgan, 1998; Steckler, McLeroy, Goodman, Bird, & McCormick, 1992). This model generally uses separate quantitative and qualitative methods as a means to offset the weaknesses inherent within one method with the strengths of the other (or conversely, the strength of one adds to the strength of the other). In this approach, the quantitative and qualitative data collection is concurrent, happening in one phase of the research study. Ideally, the weight is equal between the two methods, but often in practice, priority may be given to one or the other. The mixing during this approach, usually found in an interpretation or discussion section, is to actually merge the data (i.e., transform one type of data to the other type of
