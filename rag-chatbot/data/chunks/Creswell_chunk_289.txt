to clearly identify this sequence, and locating and specifying how the variables will be measured or observed. Finally, the intent of using the variables quantitatively will be either to relate variables, as one typically finds in a survey, or to compare samples or groups in terms of an outcome, as commonly found in experiments. The major components of a good quantitative purpose statement include the following: • Include words to signal the major intent of the study, such as purpose, intent, or objective. Start with “The purpose (or objective or intent) of this study is (was, will be) . . .” • Identify the theory, model, or conceptual framework. At this point one does not need to describe it in detail; in Chapter 3, I suggested the possibility of writing a separate “Theoretical Perspective” section for this purpose. Mentioning it in the purpose statement provides emphasis on the importance of the theory and foreshadows its use in the study. • Identify the independent and dependent variables, as well as any mediating, moderating, or control variables used in the study. • Use words that connect the independent and dependent variables to indicate that they are related, such as “the relationship between”
