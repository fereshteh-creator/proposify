and is a popular experimental design. The participants are randomly assigned to groups, a treatment is given only to the experimental group, and both groups are measured on the post-test. Group A R—————X—————O Group B R———————————O Solomon Four-Group Design A special case of a 2 X 2 factorial design, this procedure involves the random assignment of participants to four groups. Pre-tests and treatments are varied for the four groups. All groups receive a post-test.

The target behavior of a single individual is established over time and is referred to as a baseline behavior. The baseline behavior is assessed, the treatment provided, and then the treatment is withdrawn.

Experimental researchers need to identify potential threats to the internal validity of their experiments and design them so that these threats will not likely arise
