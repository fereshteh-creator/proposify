whether an instrument might be a good one to use in survey research. This form of validity is different than identifying the threats to validity in experimental research, as discussed later in this chapter. Also discuss whether scores resulting from past use of the instrument demonstrate reliability. Look for whether authors report measures of internal consistency (are the items’ responses consistent across constructs?) and test-retest correlations (are scores stable over time when the instrument is administered a second time?). Also determine whether there was consistency in test administration and scoring (were errors caused by carelessness in administration or scoring?; Borg, Gall, & Gall, 1993). • When one modifies an instrument or combines instruments in a study, the original validity and reliability may not hold for the new instrument, and it becomes important to reestablish validity and reliability during data analysis. • Include sample items from the instrument so that readers can see the actual items used. In an appendix to the proposal, attach sample items or the entire instrument. • Indicate the major content sections in the instrument, such as the cover letter (Dillman, 1978, provides a useful list of items to include in cover letters), the items (e.g., demographics,
