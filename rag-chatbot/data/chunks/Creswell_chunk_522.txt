use of theory in this study as inductive (as in qualitative inquiry), drawn from the literature (as in quantitative research), and ultimately as generated during the process of research. Example 10.3A Transformative Strategy of Inquiry A feminist lens was used in a transformative triangulation mixed methods study by Bhopal (2000). She was interested in examining whether theories of patriarchy apply to South Asian women (from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) living in East London. Since these women often have arranged marriages and are given dowries, she assumed that forms of patriarchy exist for them that do not exist for White women in Britain. Her overall aim was to “build up a detailed knowledge of women’s lives, their feelings towards their own roles and what they actually did in the home, their attitudes towards arranged marriages, dowries, domestic labour and domestic finance” (p. 70). She studied 60 women using qualitative and quantitative methods, [to] investigate the varying significance of difference through which women experienced patriarchy . . . and to present accurate information regarding the number of women who --- Seite 204 --- experienced different forms of patriarchy and test for the strength of associations between different influences of patriarchy.
