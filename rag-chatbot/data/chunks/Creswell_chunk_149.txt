the social science disciplines of psychology, sociology, anthropology, education, and economics, as well as within many subfields. To locate and read about these theories requires searching literature databases (e.g., Psychological Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts) or reviewing guides to the literature about theories (e.g., see Webb, Beals, & White, 1986). Forms of Theories Researchers state their theories in research proposals in several ways, such as a series of hypotheses, if-then logic statements, or visual models. First, some researchers state theories in --- Seite 62 --- the form of interconnected hypotheses. For example, Hopkins (1964) conveyed his theory of influence processes as a series of 15 hypotheses. Some of the hypotheses are as follows (these have been slightly altered to remove the gender-specific pronouns): 1. The higher one’s rank, the greater one’s centrality. 2. The greater one’s centrality, the greater one’s observability. 3. The higher one’s rank, the greater one’s observability. 4. The greater one’s centrality, the greater one’s conformity. 5. The higher one’s rank, the greater one’s conformity. 6. The greater one’s observability, the greater one’s conformity. 7. The greater one’s conformity, the greater one’s observability. (p. 51) A second way is to state a theory as a series of if-then statements
