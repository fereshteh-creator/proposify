the independent variable) on _________ (dependent variable). Guidelines for writing good quantitative research questions and hypotheses include the following. • The use of variables in research questions or hypotheses is typically limited to three basic approaches. The researcher may compare groups on an independent variable to see its impact on a dependent variable. Alternatively, the investigator may relate one or more independent variables to one or more dependent variables. Third, the researcher may describe responses to the independent, mediating, or dependent variables. Most quantitative research falls into one or more of these three categories. • The most rigorous form of quantitative research follows from a test of a theory (see Chapter 3) and the specification of research questions or hypotheses that are included in the theory. • The independent and dependent variables must be measured separately. This procedure reinforces the cause-and-effect logic of quantitative research. • To eliminate redundancy, write only research questions or hypotheses, not both, unless the hypotheses build on the research questions (discussion follows). Choose the form based on tradition, recommendations from an adviser or faculty committee, or whether past research indicates a prediction about outcomes. • If hypotheses are used, there are two forms: null and
