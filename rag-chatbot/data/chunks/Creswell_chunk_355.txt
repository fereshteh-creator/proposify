desirable is a nonprobability sample (or convenience sample), in which respondents are chosen based on their convenience and availability (Babbie, 1990). With randomization, a representative sample from a population provides the ability to generalize to a population. • Identify whether the study will involve stratification of the population before selecting the sample. Stratification means that specific characteristics of individuals (e.g., both females and males) are represented in the sample and the sample reflects the true proportion in the population of individuals with certain characteristics (Fowler, 2002). When randomly selecting people from a population, these characteristics may or may not be present in the sample in the same proportions as in the population; stratification ensures their representation. Also identify the characteristics used in stratifying the population (e.g., gender, income levels, education). Within each stratum, identify whether the sample contains individuals with the characteristic in the same proportion as the characteristic appears in the entire population (Babbie, 1990; Miller, 1991). • Discuss the procedures for selecting the sample from available lists. The most rigorous method for selecting the sample is to choose individuals using a random numbers table, a table available in many introductory statistics texts (e.g., Gravetter & Wallnau, 2000). •
