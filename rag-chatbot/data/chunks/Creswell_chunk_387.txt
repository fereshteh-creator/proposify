conclusion validity that arise when experimenters draw inaccurate inferences from the data because of inadequate statistical power or the violation of statistical assumptions. Threats to construct validity occur when investigators use inadequate definitions and measures of variables. Table 8.5 Types of Threats to Internal Validity --- Seite 153 --- SOURCE: Adapted from Creswell (2008). --- Seite 154 --- Practical research tips for proposal writers to address validity issues are as follows: • Identify the potential threats to validity that may arise in your study. A separate section in a proposal may be composed to advance this threat. • Define the exact type of threat and what potential issue it presents to your study. Table 8.6 Types of Threats to External Validity SOURCE: Adapted from Creswell (2008). --- Seite 155 --- • Discuss how you plan to address the threat in the design of your experiment. • Cite references to books that discuss the issue of threats to validity, such as Cook and Campbell (1979); Creswell (2008); Reichardt and Mark (1998); Shadish, Cook, & Campbell (2001); and Tuckman (1999). The Procedure A proposal developer needs to describe in detail the procedure for conducting the experiment. A reader should be able to
