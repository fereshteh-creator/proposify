the researcher might collect both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and integrate or merge the two databases by transforming the qualitative themes into counts and comparing these counts with descriptive quantitative data. In this case, the mixing consists of integrating the two databases by actually merging the quantitative data with the qualitative data. In a final scenario, the researcher might have a primary aim to collect one form of data (say quantitative) and have the other form of data (say qualitative) provide supportive information. Neither integrating the data nor connecting across phases is being utilized. Instead, the researcher is embedding a secondary form of data within a larger study having a different form of data as the primary database. The secondary database provides a supporting role in the study. Theorizing or Transforming Perspectives A final factor to consider is whether a larger, theoretical perspective guides the entire design. It may be a theory from the social sciences (e.g., adoption theory, leadership theory, attribution theory) or a broad theoretical lens, such as an advocacy/participatory lens (e.g., gender, race, class; see Chapter 3). All researchers bring theories, frameworks and hunches to their inquiries, and these theories may be made explicit in a
