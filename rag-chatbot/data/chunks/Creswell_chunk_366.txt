plotted out on a graph or non- normally distributed. There are additional ways to determine if the scores are normally distributed (see Creswell, 2008). These factors, in combination, enable a researcher to determine what statistical test will be suited for answering the research question or hypothesis. In Table 8.3, I show how the factors, in combination, lead to the selection of a number of common statistical tests. For further types of statistical tests, readers are referred to statistics methods books, such as Gravetter and Wallnau (2000). Step 6. A final step in the data analysis is to present the results in tables or figures and interpret the results from the statistical test. An interpretation of the results means that the researcher draws conclusions from the results for the research questions, hypotheses, and the larger meaning of the results. This interpretation involves several steps. --- Seite 144 --- Table 8.3 Criteria for Choosing Select Statistical Tests • Report whether the results of the statistical test were statistically significant or not, such as “the analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference between men and women in terms of attitudes toward banning smoking in restaurants F (2; 6) = 8.55, p =.001.”
