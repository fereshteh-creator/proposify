not the results were significant, drawing on past literature that you reviewed (Chapter 2), the theory used in the study (Chapter 3), or persuasive logic that might explain the results. Address whether the results might have occurred because of inadequate experimental procedures, such as threats to internal validity, and indicate how the results might be generalized to certain people, settings, and times. Finally, indicate the implications of the results for the population studied or for future research. Example 8.6An Experimental Method Section The following is a selected passage from a quasi-experimental study by Enns and Hackett (1990) that demonstrates many of the components in an experimental design. Their study addressed --- Seite 157 --- the general issue of matching client and counselor interests along the dimensions of attitudes toward feminism. They hypothesized that feminist participants would be more receptive to a radical feminist counselor than would nonfeminist participants and that nonfeminist participants would be more receptive to a nonsexist and liberal feminist counselor.
