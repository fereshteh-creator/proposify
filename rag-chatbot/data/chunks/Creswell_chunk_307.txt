Example 6.9A Sequential Mixed Methods Purpose Statement Ansorge, Creswell, Swidler, and Gutmann (2001) studied the use of wireless iBook laptop computers in three teacher education methods courses. These laptop computers enabled students to work at their desks and use the laptops to log directly onto Web sites recommended by the instructors. The purpose statement was as follows: --- Seite 122 --- The purpose of this sequential, mixed methods study was to first explore and generate themes about student use of iBook laptops in three teacher education classes using field observations and face-to-face interviews. Then, based on these themes, the second phase was to develop an instrument and to survey students about the laptop use on several dimensions. The rationale for using both qualitative and quantitative data was that a useful survey of student experience could best be developed only after a preliminary exploration of student use. In this example, the statement begins with the signal words, “the purpose of.” It then mentions the type of mixed methods design and contains the basic elements of both an initial qualitative phase and
