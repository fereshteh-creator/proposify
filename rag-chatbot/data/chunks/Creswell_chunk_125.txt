school transcripts” (Locke et al., 2007, p. 130). • Although no one format exists for defining terms, one approach is to develop a separate section, called the “Definition of Terms,” and clearly set off the terms and their definitions by highlighting the term. In this way, the word is assigned an invariant meaning (Locke et al., 2007). Typically, this separate section is not more than two to three pages in length. Two examples illustrate varied structures for defining terms in a research study: Example 2.3Terms Defined in a Mixed Methods Dissertation This first example illustrates a lengthy definition of terms presented in a mixed methods study in a separate section of Chapter 1, which introduces the study. VanHorn-Grassmeyer (1998) studied how 119 new professionals in student affairs in colleges and universities engage in reflection, either individually or collaboratively. She both surveyed the new professionals and conducted in-depth interviews with them. Because she studied individual and collaborative reflection among student affairs professionals, she provided detailed definitions of these terms in the beginning of the study. I illustrate two of her terms below. Notice how she referenced her definitions in meanings formed by other authors in the literature: Individual Reflection --- Seite
