at the research site with a preliminary copy of any publications from the research (Creswell, 2007). • An important issue in writing a scholarly manuscript is to not exploit the labor of colleagues and to provide authorship to individuals who substantially contribute to publications. Isreal and Hay (2006) discuss the unethical practice of so-called gift authorship to individuals who do not --- Seite 97 --- contribute to a manuscript and ghost authorship, in which junior staff who made significant contributions have been omitted from the list of authors. • Finally, it is important to release the details of the research with the study design so that readers can determine for themselves the credibility of the study (Neuman, 2000). Detailed procedures for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research will be emphasized in the chapters to follow. Also, researchers should not engage in duplicate or redundant publication in which authors publish papers that present exactly the same data, discussions, and conclusions and do not offer new material. Some biomedical journals now require authors to declare whether they have published or are preparing to publish papers that are closely related to the manuscript that has been submitted (Isreal & Hay, 2006).
