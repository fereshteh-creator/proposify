that discuss the issue of threats to validity, such as Cook and Campbell (1979); Creswell (2008); Reichardt and Mark (1998); Shadish, Cook, & Campbell (2001); and Tuckman (1999). The Procedure A proposal developer needs to describe in detail the procedure for conducting the experiment. A reader should be able to understand the design being used, the observations, the treatment, and the timeline of activities. • Discuss a step-by-step approach for the procedure in the experiment. For example, Borg and Gall (1989, p. 679) outlined six steps typically used in the procedure for a pre-test-post-test control group design with matching participants in the experimental and control groups: 1. Administer measures of the dependent variable or a variable closely correlated with the dependent variable to the research participants. 2. Assign participants to matched pairs on the basis of their scores on the measures described in Step 1. 3. Randomly assign one member of each pair to the experimental group and the other member to the control group. 4. Expose the experimental group to the experimental treatment and administer no treatment or an alternative treatment to the control group. 5. Administer measures of the dependent variables to the experimental and control groups. ---
