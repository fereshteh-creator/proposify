a picture of the procedures, it is helpful to discuss the specific types of data to be collected. It is also important to identify the sampling strategies and the approaches used to establish validity of the data. • Identify and be specific about the type of data—both quantitative and qualitative—that will be collected during the proposed study. Refer to Table 1.3, which shows both quantitative and qualitative data. Data differs in terms of open-ended versus closed-ended responses. Some forms of data, such as interviews and observations, can be either quantitative or qualitative depending on how open (qualitative) or closed (quantitative) the response options might be in an interview or a checklist for an observation. Although reducing information to numbers is the approach used in quantitative research, it is also used in qualitative research. • Recognize that quantitative data often involve random sampling, so that each individual has an equal probability of being selected, and the sample can be generalized to the larger population. In qualitative data collection, purposeful sampling is used so that individuals are selected because they have experienced the central phenomenon. Rigorous sampling procedures need to be conveyed in a proposal for the quantitative and qualitative data collection.
