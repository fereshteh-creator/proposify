form of differences (e.g., higher, lower, more, less) is not specified because the researcher does not know what can be predicted from past literature. Thus, the investigator might write, “There --- Seite 130 --- is a difference” between the two groups. An example follows which incorporates both types of hypotheses: Example 7.5Nondirectional and Directional Hypotheses Sometimes directional hypotheses are created to examine the relationship among variables rather than to compare groups. For example, Moore (2000) studied the meaning of gender identity for religious and secular Jewish and Arab women in Israeli society. In a national probability sample of Jewish and Arab women, the author identified three hypotheses for study. The first is nondirectional and the last two are directional. H1: Gender identity of religious and secular Arab and Jewish women are related to different sociopolitical social orders that reflect the different value systems they embrace. H2: Religious women with salient gender identity are less socio-politically active than secular women with salient gender identities. H3: The relationships among gender identity, religiosity, and social actions are weaker among Arab women than among Jewish women. • Unless the study intentionally employs demographic variables as predictors, use nondemographic variables (i.e., attitudes or behaviors) as
