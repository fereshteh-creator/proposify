plan to use. Further, they need to advance a visual figure that presents the procedures they plan to use. Figures 10.2 and 10.3 provide some useful models for guidance. Here are some research tips about how to select a mixed methods strategy: • Use the information in Figure 10.1 to assess the aspects that you will be working with in your mixed methods procedures, and then identify one of the six approaches discussed in this chapter as the primary design for your proposed study. Provide a working definition for this design, along with a visual model and a rationale as to why it is a useful design for you to us. --- Seite 199 --- • Consider the amount of time you have to collect data. Concurrent approaches are less time consuming because both qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time in the same visit to the field. • Remember that the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data is a rigorous, time-consuming process. When time is a problem, I encourage students to think about an embedded model of design. This model emphasizes a major primary form of data collection (e.g., surveys), and it can
