(p. 267) --- Seite 73 --- Example 3.2 A Theory Early in a Qualitative Study Murguia, Padilla, and Pavel (1991) studied the integration of 24 Hispanic and Native American students into the social system of a college campus. They were curious about how ethnicity influenced social integration, and they began by relating the participants’ experiences to a theoretical model, the Tinto model of social integration. They felt that the model had been “incompletely conceptualized and, as a consequence, only imprecisely understood and measured” (p. 433). Thus, the model was not being tested, as one would find in a quantitative project, but modified. At the end of the study, the authors refined Tinto’s model and advanced their modification that described how ethnicity functions. In contrast to this approach, in qualitative studies with an end point of a theory (e.g., a grounded theory), a pattern, or a generalization, the theory emerges at the end of the study. This theory might be presented as a logic diagram, a visual representation of relationships among concepts. Example 3.3 A Theory at the End of a Qualitative Study Using a national database of 33 interviews with academic department chairpersons, we (Creswell & Brown, 1992) developed a
