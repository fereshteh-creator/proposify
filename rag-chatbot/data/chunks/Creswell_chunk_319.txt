researcher is trying to explain why something occurs, and this suggests to me a cause-and-effect type of thinking that I associate with quantitative research instead of the more open and emerging stance of qualitative research. • Focus on a single phenomenon or concept. As a study develops over time, factors will emerge that may influence this single phenomenon, but begin a study with a single focus to explore in great detail. • Use exploratory verbs that convey the language of emerging design. These verbs tell the reader that the study will • Discover (e.g., grounded theory) • Seek to understand (e.g., ethnography) • Explore a process (e.g., case study) • Describe the experiences (e.g., phenomenology) • Report the stories (e.g., narrative research) • Use these more exploratory verbs that are nondirectional rather than directional words that suggest quantitative research, such as “affect,” “influence,” “impact,” “determine,” “cause,” and “relate.” • Expect the research questions to evolve and change during the study in a manner consistent with the assumptions of an emerging design. Often in qualitative studies, the questions are under continual review and reformulation (as in a grounded theory study). This approach may be problematic for individuals accustomed to quantitative designs,
