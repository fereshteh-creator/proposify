researcher’s approach is consistent across different researchers and different projects (Gibbs, 2007). How do qualitative researchers check to determine if their approaches are consistent or reliable? Yin (2003) suggests that qualitative researchers need to document the procedures of their case studies and to document as many of the steps of the procedures as possible. He also --- Seite 177 --- recommends setting up a detailed case study protocol and database. Gibbs (2007) suggests several reliability procedures: • Check transcripts to make sure that they do not contain obvious mistakes made during transcription. • Make sure that there is not a drift in the definition of codes, a shift in the meaning of the codes during the process of coding. This can be accomplished by constantly comparing data with the codes and by writing memos about the codes and their definitions (see the discussion on a qualitative codebook). • For team research, coordinate the communication among the coders by regular documented meetings and by sharing the analysis. • Cross-check codes developed by different researchers by comparing results that are independently derived. Proposal writers need to include several of these procedures as evidence that they will have consistent results in their proposed
