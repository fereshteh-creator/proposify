in it could be contrasted with the existing theories and literature. MIXED METHODS THEORY USE Theory use in mixed methods studies may include theory deductively, in quantitative theory testing and verification, or inductively as in an emerging qualitative theory or pattern. A social science or a health science theory may be used as a framework to be tested in either a quantitative or qualitative approach to inquiry. Another way to think about theory in mixed methods research is as a theoretical lens or perspective to guide the study. Studies are beginning to emerge that employ mixed methods designs using a lens to study gender, race or ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and other bases of diversity (Mertens, 2003). --- Seite 74 --- Historically, the idea of using a theoretical lens in mixed methods research was mentioned by Greene and Caracelli in 1997. They identified the use of a transformative design as a distinct form of mixed methods research. This design gave primacy to value-based, action-oriented research, such as in participatory action research and empowerment approaches. In this design, they suggest mixing the value commitments of different traditions (e.g., bias-free from quantitative and bias-laden from qualitative), the use of diverse methods, and
