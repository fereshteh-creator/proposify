the treatment procedures. This mixed methods model is attractive for several reasons. A researcher is able to collect the two types of data simultaneously, during a single data collection phase. It provides a study with the advantages of both quantitative and qualitative data. In addition, by using the two different methods in this fashion, a researcher can gain perspectives from the different types of data or from different levels within the study. There are also limitations to consider when choosing this approach. The data need to be transformed in some way so that they can be integrated within the analysis phase of the research. In addition, if the two databases are compared, discrepancies may occur that need to be resolved. Because the two methods are unequal in their priority, this approach also results in unequal evidence within a study, which may be a disadvantage when interpreting the final results. Concurrent Transformative Strategy As with the sequential transformative model, the concurrent transformative approach is guided by the researcher’s use of a specific theoretical perspective as well as the concurrent collection of both quantitative and qualitative data (see Figure 10.3c). This perspective can be based on ideologies such as critical theory, advocacy,
