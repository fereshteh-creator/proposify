Strategy of Inquiry Kushman (1992) studied two types of teacher workplace commitment—organizational commitment and commitment to student learning—in 63 urban elementary and middle schools. He posed a two-phase explanatory sequential mixed methods study, as presented in the purpose statement: The central premise of this study was that organizational commitment and commitment to student learning address distinct but equally important teacher attitudes for an organizationally effective school, an idea that has some support in the literature but requires further empirical validation. . . . Phase 1 was a quantitative study that looked at statistical relationships between teacher commitment and organizational antecedents and outcomes in elementary and middle schools. Following this macrolevel analysis, Phase 2 looked within specific schools, using qualitative/case study methods to better understand the dynamics of teacher commitment. (Kushman, 1992, p. 13) This purpose statement illustrates the combination of a purpose with the rationale for mixing (“to better understand”) as well as the specific types of data collected during the study. The introduction focused on the need to examine organizational commitment and commitment to student learning, leading to a priority for the quantitative approach. This priority was further illustrated in sections defining organizational commitment and commitment to student learning
