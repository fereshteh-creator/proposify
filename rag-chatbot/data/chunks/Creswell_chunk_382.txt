by a measure. Group A X_____________________O One-Group Pre-Test-Post-Test Design This design includes a pre-test measure followed by a treatment and a post-test for a single group. Group A 01————X————02 Static Group Comparison or Post-Test-Only With Nonequivalent Groups Experimenters use this design after implementing a treatment. After the treatment, the researcher selects a comparison group and provides a post-test to both the experimental group(s) and the comparison group(s). Group A X_____________________O ______________________________ Group B ________________________O Alternative Treatment Post-Test-Only With Nonequivalent Groups Design This design uses the same procedure as the Static Group Comparison, with the exception that the nonequivalent comparison group received a different treatment. Group A X1____________________O _____________________________ Group B X2 _____________________ O Example 8.3Quasi-Experimental Designs Nonequivalent (Pre-Test and Post-Test) Control-Group Design In this design, a popular approach to quasi-experiments, the experimental group A and the control group B are selected without random assignment. Both groups take a pre-test and post- test. Only the experimental group receives the treatment.
