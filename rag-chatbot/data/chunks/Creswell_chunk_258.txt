Often, multiple research problems are addressed in research studies. Studies Addressing the Problem After establishing the research problem in the opening paragraphs, Terenzini et al. (2001) next justify its importance by reviewing studies that have examined the issue. I must be careful as I talk about reviewing studies here, because I do not have in mind a complete literature review for the introduction passage. It is later, in the literature review section of a proposal, that students thoroughly review the literature. Instead, in the introduction, this literature review passage should summarize large groups of studies instead of individual ones. I tell my students to reflect on their literature maps (described in Chapter 2) and look at and summarize the broad categories at the top into which they assigned their literature. Mentioning these broad categories are what I mean by reviewing studies in an introduction to
