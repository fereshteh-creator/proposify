t tests or univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), or multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA—multiple dependent measures). (Several of these tests are mentioned in Table 8.3, presented earlier.) In factorial designs, both interaction and main effects of ANOVA are used. When data on a pre-test or post-test show marked deviation from a normal distribution, use nonparametric statistical tests. • For single-subject research designs, use line graphs for baseline and treatment observations for abscissa (horizontal axis) units of time and the ordinate (vertical axis) target behavior. Each data point is plotted separately on the graph, and the data points are connected by lines (e.g., see Neuman & McCormick, 1995). Occasionally, tests of statistical significance, such as t tests, are used to compare the pooled mean of the baseline and the treatment phases, although such procedures may violate the assumption of independent measures (Borg & Gall, 1989). • With increasing frequency, experimental researchers report both statistical results of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals and effect size as indicators of practical significance of the findings. A confidence interval is an interval estimate of the range of upper and lower statistical values that are consistent with the observed data and are
