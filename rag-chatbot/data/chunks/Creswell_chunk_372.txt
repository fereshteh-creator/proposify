ensuring that the sample will be representative of the population (Keppel, 1991). In many experiments, however, only a convenience sample is possible because the investigator must use naturally formed groups (e.g., a classroom, an organization, a family unit) or volunteers. When individuals are not randomly assigned, the procedure is called a quasi-experiment. • When individuals can be randomly assigned to groups, the procedure is called a true experiment. If random assignment is made, discuss how the project will randomly assign individuals to the treatment groups. This means that of the pool of participants, Individual 1 goes to Group 1, Individual 2 to Group 2, and so forth, so that there is no systematic bias in assigning the individuals. This procedure eliminates the possibility of systematic differences among characteristics of the participants that could affect the outcomes, so that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the experimental treatment (Keppel, 1991). • Identify other features in the experimental design that will systematically control the variables that might influence the outcome. One approach is matching participants in terms of a certain trait or characteristic and then assigning one individual from each matched set to each group. For example, scores on a
