the experimental group. In quasi-experiments, the investigator uses control and experimental groups but does not randomly assign participants to groups (e.g., they may be intact groups available to the researcher). In a true experiment, the investigator randomly assigns the participants to treatment groups. A single-subject design or N of 1 design involves observing the behavior of a single individual (or a small number of individuals) over time. • Identify what is being compared in the experiment. In many experiments, those of a type called between-subject designs, the investigator compares two or more groups (Keppel, 1991; Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991). For example, a factorial design experiment, a variation on the between-group design, involves using two or more treatment variables to examine the independent and simultaneous effects of these treatment variables on an outcome (Vogt, 1999). This widely used behavioral research design explores the effects of each treatment separately and also the effects of variables used in combination, thereby providing a rich and revealing multidimensional view (Keppel, 1991). In other experiments, the researcher studies only one group in what is called a within-group design. For example, in a repeated measures design, participants are assigned to different treatments at different times during the
