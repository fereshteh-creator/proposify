rural hospitals. He reviewed the literature in several chapters at the beginning of the study. In an example of summarizing a single study advancing a typology, Sudduth summarized the problem, the theme, and the typology: Ginter, Duncan, Richardson, and Swayne (1991) recognize the impact of the external environment on a hospital’s ability to adapt to change. They advocate a process that they call environmental analysis which allows the organization to strategically determine the best responses to change occurring in the environment. However, after examining the multiple techniques used for environmental analysis, it appears that no comprehensive conceptual scheme or computer model has been developed to provide a complete analysis of environmental issues (Ginter et al., 1991). The result is an essential part of strategic change that relies heavily on a non-quantifiable and judgmental process of evaluation. To assist the hospital manager to carefully assess the external environment, Ginter et al. (1991) have developed the typology given in Figure 2.1. (Sudduth, 1992, p. 44) In this example, the authors referenced the study with an in-text reference, mentioned the problem (“a hospital’s ability to adapt to change”), identified the central theme (“a process that they call environmental analysis”), and stated the conclusions
