are organized around whether the data are collected sequentially (explanatory and exploratory), concurrently (triangulation and nested), or with a transformative lens (sequential or concurrent). Each model has strengths and weaknesses, although the sequential approach is the easiest to implement. Choice of strategy also can be presented in a figure in the research proposal. Then, specific procedures can be related to the figure to help the reader understand the flow of activities in a project. These include the types of quantitative and qualitative data to be collected as well as the procedures for data analysis. Typically, data analysis involves data transformation, exploring outliers, examining multiple levels, or creating matrices that combine the quantitative results and the qualitative findings. Validity procedures also need to be explicitly described. The final written report, because it may be unfamiliar to --- Seite 205 --- audiences, can also be described in a proposal. Each of the three types of strategies— sequential, concurrent, and transformative—has a different structural approach to writing a mixed methods study. Writing Exercises 1. Design a combined qualitative and quantitative study that employs two phases sequentially. Discuss and provide a rationale for why the phases are ordered in the sequence you propose. 2.
