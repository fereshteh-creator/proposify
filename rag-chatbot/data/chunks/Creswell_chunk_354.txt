Questions of access arise here, and the researcher might refer to availability of sampling frames—mail or published lists—of potential respondents in the population. • Identify whether the sampling design for this population is single stage or multistage (called clustering). Cluster sampling is ideal when it is impossible or impractical to compile a list of the elements composing the population (Babbie, 2007). A single-stage sampling procedure is one in which the researcher has access to names in the population and can sample the people (or other elements) directly. In a multistage or clustering procedure, the researcher first identifies --- Seite 140 --- clusters (groups or organizations), obtains names of individuals within those clusters, and then samples within them. • Identify the selection process for individuals. I recommend selecting a random sample, in which each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected (a systematic or probabilistic sample). Less desirable is a nonprobability sample (or convenience sample), in which respondents are chosen based on their convenience and availability (Babbie, 1990). With randomization, a representative sample from a population provides the ability to generalize to a population. • Identify whether the study will involve stratification of the population before selecting
