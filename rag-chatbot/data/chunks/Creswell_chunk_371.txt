form: participants, materials, procedures, and measures. These four topics generally are sufficient. In this section of the chapter, I review these components as well as information about the experimental design and statistical analysis. As with the section on surveys, the intent here is to highlight key topics to be addressed in an experimental method proposal. An overall guide to these topics is found by answering the questions on the checklist shown in Table 8.4. Participants Readers need to know about the selection, assignment, and number of participants who will take part in the experiment. Consider the following suggestions when writing the method section for an experiment: • Describe the selection process for participants as either random or nonrandom (e.g., conveniently selected). The participants might be selected by random selection or random sampling. With random selection or random sampling, each individual has an equal probability of being selected from the population, ensuring that the sample will be representative of the population (Keppel, 1991). In many experiments, however, only a convenience sample is possible because the investigator must use naturally formed groups (e.g., a classroom, an organization, a family unit) or volunteers. When individuals are not randomly assigned, the procedure is called
