generalized to some broader theory. The generalization occurs when --- Seite 179 --- qualitative researchers study additional cases and generalize findings to the new cases. It is the same as the replication logic used in experimental research. However, to repeat a case study’s findings in a new case setting requires good documentation of qualitative procedures, such as a protocol for documenting the problem in detail and the development of a thorough case study database (Yin, 2003). THE QUALITATIVE WRITE-UP A plan for a qualitative procedure should end with some comments about the narrative that emerges from the data analysis. Numerous varieties of narratives exist, and examples from scholarly journals illustrate models. In a plan for a study, consider advancing several points about the narrative. The basic procedure in reporting the results of a qualitative study are to develop descriptions and themes from the data (see Figure 9.1), to present these descriptions and themes that convey multiple perspectives from participants and detailed descriptions of the setting or individuals.
