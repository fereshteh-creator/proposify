of being selected, and the sample can be generalized to the larger population. In qualitative data collection, purposeful sampling is used so that individuals are selected because they have experienced the central phenomenon. Rigorous sampling procedures need to be conveyed in a proposal for the quantitative and qualitative data collection. In addition, Teddlie and Yu (2007) have developed a typology of five types of mixed methods sampling which relates sampling to the strategies for mixed methods that I have discussed: --- Seite 200 --- • Basic strategies that involve combining quantitative and qualitative sampling (e.g., stratified purposeful sampling, purposive random sampling) • Sequential sampling, in which the sampling from the first phase or strand informs the second phase or strand • Concurrent sampling, in which quantitative probability and qualitative purposeful sampling are combined as independent sampling procedures or jointly (e.g., a survey with both closed- ended and open-ended responses) • Multilevel sampling, in which sampling occurs in two or more levels or units of analysis • Sampling using any combination of the foregoing strategies • Include detailed procedures in your visual model. For example, in a sequential explanatory model, the general procedures are higher on the page and the detailed
