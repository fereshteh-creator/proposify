map that shows the major categories of studies and positions your proposed study within those categories. Begin writing summaries of the studies, noting complete references according to a style manual (e.g., APA, 2001) and extracting information about the research that includes the research problem, the questions, the data collection and analysis, and the final results. Define key terms, and possibly develop a definition of terms section for your proposal or include them within your literature review. Finally, consider the overall structure for organizing these studies. One quantitative research model is to divide the review into sections according to major variables (a quantitative approach) or major subthemes of the central phenomenon (a qualitative approach) that you are studying. Writing Exercises 1. Develop a literature map of the literature on your topic. Include in the map the proposed study and draw lines from the proposed study to other categories of studies so that a reader can easily see how yours will extend existing literature. 2. Organize a review of the literature for a quantitative study and follow the model for delimiting the literature to reflect the variables in the study. As an alternative, organize a review of literature for a qualitative study
