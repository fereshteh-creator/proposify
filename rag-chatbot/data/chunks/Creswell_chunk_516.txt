typically presents the project as two distinct phases, with separate headings for each phase. • In a concurrent study, the quantitative and qualitative data collection may be presented in separate sections, but the analysis and interpretation combines the two forms of data to seek convergence or similarities among the results. The structure of this type of mixed methods study does not make a clear distinction between the quantitative and qualitative phases. • In a transformative study, the structure typically involves advancing the advocacy issue in the beginning and then using either the sequential or concurrent structure as a means of organizing the content. In the end, a separate section may advance an agenda for change or reform that has developed as a result of the research. EXAMPLES OF MIXED METHODS PROCEDURES Illustrations follow of mixed methods studies that use both the sequential and concurrent strategies and procedures. Example 10.1A Sequential Strategy of Inquiry Kushman (1992) studied two types of teacher workplace commitment—organizational commitment and commitment to student learning—in 63 urban elementary and middle schools.
