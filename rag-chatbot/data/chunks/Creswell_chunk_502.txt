Transformative Strategy As with the sequential transformative model, the concurrent transformative approach is guided by the researcher’s use of a specific theoretical perspective as well as the concurrent collection of both quantitative and qualitative data (see Figure 10.3c). This perspective can be based on ideologies such as critical theory, advocacy, participatory research, or a conceptual or theoretical framework. This perspective is reflected in the purpose or research questions of the study. It is the driving force behind all methodological choices, such as defining the problem, identifying the design and data sources, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting results. The choice of a concurrent model, whether it is triangulation or embedded design, is made to facilitate this perspective. For example, the design may have one method embedded in the other so that diverse participants are given a voice in the change process of an organization. It may involve a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data to best converge information to provide evidence for an inequality of policies in an organization. Thus, the concurrent transformative model may take on the design features of either a triangulation or an embedded approach (the two types of data are collected at the same time during one data
