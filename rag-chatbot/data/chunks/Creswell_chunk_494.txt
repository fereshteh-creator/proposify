give voice to diverse perspectives, to better advocate for participants, or to better understand a phenomenon or process that is changing as a result of being studied. The sequential transformative model shares the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the other two sequential approaches. Its use of distinct phases facilitates its implementation, description, and sharing of results, although it also requires the time to complete two data collection phases. More important, this design places mixed methods research within a transformative framework. Therefore, this strategy may be more appealing and acceptable to those researchers already using a transformative framework within one distinct methodology, such as qualitative research. Unfortunately, because little has been written to date on this approach, one weakness is that there is little guidance on how to use the transformative vision to guide the methods. Likewise, as with all sequential strategies, key decisions need to be made about what findings in the first phase will be the focus of the second phase. Concurrent Triangulation Strategy The concurrent triangulation approach is probably the most familiar of the six major mixed methods models (see Figure 10.3a). In a concurrent triangulation approach, the researcher collects both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and then
