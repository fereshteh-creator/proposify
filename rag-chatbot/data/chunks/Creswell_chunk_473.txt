qualitative and quantitative modes of inquiry, and the use of multiple methods introduced in Chapter 1. It also extends the discussion about research problems that incorporate the need both to explore and explain (Chapter 5). It follows a purpose statement and research questions focused on understanding a problem using both qualitative and quantitative methods (Chapters 6 and 7), and it advances the reasons for using multiple forms of data collection and analysis (Chapters 8 and 9). COMPONENTS OF MIXED METHODS PROCEDURES Mixed methods research has evolved a set of procedures that proposal developers can use in planning a mixed methods study. In 2003, the Handbook of Mixed Methods in the Social & Behavior Sciences (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003) was published, providing the first comprehensive overview of this strategy of inquiry. Now several journals emphasize mixed methods research, such as the Journal of Mixed Methods Research, Quality and Quantity, and Field Methods, while numerous others actively encourage this form of inquiry (e.g., International Journal of Social Research Methodology, Qualitative Health Research, Annals of Family Medicine). Numerous published research studies have incorporated mixed methods research in the social and human sciences in diverse fields such as occupational therapy (Lysack & Krefting, 1994),
