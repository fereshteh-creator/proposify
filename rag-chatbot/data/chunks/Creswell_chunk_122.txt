might include a separate section if the study begins with a first phase of quantitative data collection. If it begins with qualitative data collection, then the terms may emerge during the research, and they are defined in the findings or results section of the final report. If both quantitative and qualitative data collection occurs at the same time, then the priority given to one or the other will govern the approach for definitions. However, in all mixed methods studies, there are terms that may be unfamiliar to readers—for example, the definition of a mixed methods study itself, in a procedural discussion (see Chapter 10). Also, clarify terms related to the strategy of inquiry used, such as concurrent --- Seite 54 --- or sequential, and the specific name for it (e.g., concurrent triangulation design, as discussed in Chapter 10). No one approach governs how one defines the terms in a study, but several suggestions follow (see also Locke et al., 2007): • Define a term when it first appears in the proposal. In the introduction, for example, a term may require definition to help the reader understand the research problem and questions or hypotheses in the study. • Write definitions at
