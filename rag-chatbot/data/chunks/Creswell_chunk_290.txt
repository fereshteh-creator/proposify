the theory and foreshadows its use in the study. • Identify the independent and dependent variables, as well as any mediating, moderating, or control variables used in the study. • Use words that connect the independent and dependent variables to indicate that they are related, such as “the relationship between” two or more variables, or a “comparison of” two or more groups. Most quantitative studies employ one of these two options for connecting variables in the purpose statement. A combination of comparing and relating might also exist, for example, a two-factor experiment in which the researcher has two or more treatment --- Seite 117 --- groups as well as a continuous independent variable. Although one typically finds studies about comparing two or more groups in experiments, it is also possible to compare groups in a survey study. • Position or order the variables from left to right in the purpose statement, with the independent variable followed by the dependent variable. Place intervening variables between the independent and dependent variables. Many researchers also place the moderating variables between the independent and dependent variables. Alternatively, control variables might be placed immediately following the dependent variable, in a phrase such as “controlling for
