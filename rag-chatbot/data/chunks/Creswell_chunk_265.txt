(Ziller, 1990, pp. 85-86) Example 5.2 Deficiencies in the Literature—Few Studies Despite an increased interest in micropolitics, it is surprising that so little empirical research has actually been conducted on the topic, especially from the perspectives of subordinates. Political research in educational settings is especially scarce: Very few studies have focused on how --- Seite 109 --- teachers use power to interact strategically with school principals and what this means descriptively and conceptually (Ball, 1987; Hoyle, 1986; Pratt, 1984). (Blase, 1989, p. 381) In summary, when identifying deficiencies in the past literature, proposal developers might use the following research tips: • Cite several deficiencies to make the case even stronger for a study. • Identify specifically the deficiencies of other studies (e.g., methodological flaws, variables overlooked). • Write about areas overlooked by past studies, including topics, special statistical treatments, significant implications, and so forth. • Discuss how a proposed study will remedy these deficiencies and provide a unique contribution to the scholarly literature. These deficiencies might be mentioned using a series of short paragraphs that identify three or four shortcomings of the past research or focus on one major shortcoming, as illustrated in the Terenzini et al. (2001)
