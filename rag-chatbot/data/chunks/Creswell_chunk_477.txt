(Bryman, 2006; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). Table 10.1 A Checklist of Questions for Designing a Mixed Methods Procedure --- Seite 190 --- • Briefly discuss the growth of interest in mixed methods research as expressed in books, journal articles, diverse disciplines, and funded projects (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007 for a discussion about the many initiatives that contribute to mixed methods today). • Note the challenges this form of research poses for the inquirer. These include the need for extensive data collection, the time-intensive nature of analyzing both text and numeric data, and the requirement for the researcher to be familiar with both quantitative and qualitative forms of research. TYPES OF MIXED METHODS STRATEGIES AND VISUAL MODELS There have been several typologies for classifying and identifying types of mixed methods strategies that proposal developers might use in their proposed mixed methods study. Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) identify 12 classification systems drawn from the fields of evaluation, nursing, public health, education policy and research, and social and behavioral research. In these classifications, authors use diverse terms for their types of designs, and a substantial amount of overlap exists in the typologies. For purposes of this discussion I will identify
