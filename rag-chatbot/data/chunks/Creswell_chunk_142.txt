and effect --- Seite 60 --- (Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991), and social scientists now say that there is probable causation. Temporal order means that quantitative researchers think about variables in an order from “left to right” (Punch, 2005) and order the variables in purpose statements, research questions, and visual models into left-to-right, cause-and-effect presentations. Thus, • Independent variables are those that (probably) cause, influence, or affect outcomes. They are also called treatment, manipulated, antecedent, or predictor variables. • Dependent variables are those that depend on the independent variables; they are the outcomes or results of the influence of the independent variables. Other names for dependent variables are criterion, outcome, and effect variables. • Intervening or mediating variables stand between the independent and dependent variables, and they mediate the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable. For example, if students do well on a research methods test (dependent variable), that result may be due to (a) their study preparation (independent variable) and/or (b) their organization of study ideas into a framework (intervening variable) that influenced their performance on the test. The mediating variable, the organization of study, stands between the independent and dependent variables. • Moderating variables are new
