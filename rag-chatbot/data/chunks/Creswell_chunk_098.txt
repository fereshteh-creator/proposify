The articles identified in a Google Scholar search provide links to abstracts, related articles, electronic versions of articles affiliated with a library you specify, Web searches for information about this work, and opportunities to purchase the full text of the article. Researchers can obtain abstracts to publications in the health sciences through the free-access PubMed. This database is a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and it includes over 17 million citations from MEDLINE and other life science journals for biomedical articles going back to the 1950s (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

This MeSH terminology provides a consistent way to retrieve information about topics that may be described using different terms. Academic libraries also have site licenses to important commercial databases. One typically available is ProQuest (http://proquest.com), which enables a researcher to search many different databases, and it is one of the largest online content repositories in the world.
