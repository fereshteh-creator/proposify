the research problem. Also, it makes sense that a topic is being proposed for study precisely because little research has been conducted on it. To counter this statement, I often suggest that an investigator think about the literature, using an inverted triangle as an image. At the apex of the inverted triangle lies the scholarly study being proposed. This study is narrow and focused (and studies may not exist on it). If one broadens the review of the literature upward to the base of the inverted triangle, literature can be found, although it may be somewhat removed from the study at hand. For example, the narrow topic of at-risk African Americans in primary school may not have been researched; however, more broadly speaking, the topic of at-risk students generally in the primary school or at any level in education, may have been studied. The researcher would summarize the more general literature and end with statements about a need for studies that examine at-risk African American students at the primary school level. To review the literature related to the research problem for an introduction to a proposal, consider these research tips: --- Seite 108 --- • Refer to the literature by
