a distinct form of mixed methods research. This design gave primacy to value-based, action-oriented research, such as in participatory action research and empowerment approaches. In this design, they suggest mixing the value commitments of different traditions (e.g., bias-free from quantitative and bias-laden from qualitative), the use of diverse methods, and a focus on action solutions. The implementation of these ideas in the practice of mixed methods research has now been carried forward by other authors. More information on procedures has appeared in a chapter written by Creswell, Plano Clark, Gutmann, and Hanson (2003). They identified the use of theoretical perspectives, such as gendered, feminist; cultural/ racial/ethnic; lifestyle; critical; and class and social status. These perspectives became an overlay over mixed methods designs (see Chapter 10). They further developed visual models to portray how these lenses might provide a guiding perspective for a mixed methods study. Mertens (2003) continued the discussion. As outlined in Box 3.1, she advocated for the importance of a theory lens in mixed methods research. In detailing a transformative- emancipatory paradigm and specific procedures, she emphasized the role that values played in studying feminist, ethnic/racial, and disability issues. Her transformative theory was an umbrella term for research
