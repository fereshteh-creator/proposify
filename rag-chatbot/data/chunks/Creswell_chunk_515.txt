or the use of conflicting research questions (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007 for a discussion of these ideas). REPORT PRESENTATION STRUCTURE The structure for the report, like the data analysis, follows the type of strategy chosen for the proposed study. Because mixed methods studies may not be familiar to audiences, it is helpful to provide some guidance as to how to structure the final report. • For a sequential study, mixed methods researchers typically organize the report of procedures into quantitative data collection and quantitative data analysis followed by qualitative data and collection and analysis. Then, in the conclusions or interpretation phase of the study, the researcher comments on how the qualitative findings helped to elaborate on or extend the quantitative results. Alternatively, the qualitative data collection and analysis could come first, followed by the quantitative data collection and analysis. In either structure, the --- Seite 202 --- writer typically presents the project as two distinct phases, with separate headings for each phase. • In a concurrent study, the quantitative and qualitative data collection may be presented in separate sections, but the analysis and interpretation combines the two forms of data to seek convergence or similarities among the results.
