more questions, and several custom features, SurveyMonkey charges a monthly or annual fee. • To use an existing instrument, describe the established validity and reliability of scores obtained from past use of the instrument. This means reporting efforts by authors to establish --- Seite 141 --- validity—whether one can draw meaningful and useful inferences from scores on the instruments. The three traditional forms of validity to look for are content validity (do the items measure the content they were intended to measure?), predictive or concurrent validity (do scores predict a criterion measure? Do results correlate with other results?), and construct validity (do items measure hypothetical constructs or concepts?). In more recent studies, construct validity has also included whether the scores serve a useful purpose and have positive consequences when they are used in practice (Humbley & Zumbo, 1996). Establishing the validity of the scores in a survey helps to identify whether an instrument might be a good one to use in survey research. This form of validity is different than identifying the threats to validity in experimental research, as discussed later in this chapter. Also discuss whether scores resulting from past use of the instrument demonstrate reliability. Look for whether
