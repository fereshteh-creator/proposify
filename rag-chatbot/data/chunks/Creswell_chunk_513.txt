in a proposal is the series of steps taken to check the validity of both the quantitative data and the accuracy of the qualitative findings. Writers on mixed methods advocate for the use of validity procedures for both the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). The proposal writer discusses the validity and reliability of the scores from past uses of instruments employed in the study. In addition, potential threats to internal validity for experiments and surveys are noted (see Chapter 8). For the qualitative data, the strategies that will be used to check the accuracy of the findings need to be mentioned (see Chapter 9). These may include triangulating data sources, member checking, detailed description, or other approaches. An emerging field of study is to consider how validity might be different for mixed methods studies than for a quantitative or a qualitative study. Writers have begun to develop a bilingual nomenclature for mixed methods research and have called validity legitimation (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 55). The legitimation of the mixed methods study relates to many phases of the research process, from philosophical issues (e.g., are the philosophical positions blended into a usable form?) to
