in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research problem. Concurrent transformative approach in mixed methods is guided by the researcher’s use of a specific theoretical perspective as well as the concurrent collection of both quantitative and qualitative data. Concurrent triangulation strategy in mixed methods is an approach in which the researcher collects both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and then compares the two databases to determine if there is convergence, differences, or some combination. Confidence interval is an estimate in quantitative research of the range of upper and lower statistical values that are consistent with the observed data and are likely to contain the actual population mean. --- Seite 209 --- Connected in mixed methods research means that the quantitative and qualitative research are connected between a data analysis of the first phase of research and data collection of the second phase. Construct validity occurs when investigators use adequate definitions and measures of variables. Deficiencies in past literature may exist because topics have not been explored with a particular group, sample, or population; the literature may need to be replicated or repeated to see if the same findings hold, given new samples of people or new sites for
