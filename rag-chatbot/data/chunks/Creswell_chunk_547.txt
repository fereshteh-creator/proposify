Ref lexivity means that researchers reflect about how their biases, values, and personal background, such as gender, history, culture, and socioeconomic status, shape their interpretations formed during a study. Reliability refers to whether scores to items on an instrument are internally consistent (i.e., Are the item responses consistent across constructs?), stable over time (test-retest correlations), and whether there was consistency in test administration and scoring. Research designs are plans and the procedures for research that span the decisions from broad assumptions to detailed methods of data collection and analysis. It involves the intersection of philosophical assumptions, strategies of inquiry, and specific methods. Research methods involve the forms of data collection, analysis, and interpretation that researchers propose for their studies. Research problems are the problems or issues that lead to the need for a study. Research tips are my thoughts about approaches or techniques that have worked well for me as an experienced researcher. Response bias is the effect of nonresponses on survey estimates, and it means that if nonrespondents had responded, their responses would have substantially changed the overall results of the survey. Reviewing studies in an introduction justifies the importance of the study and creates distinctions between past studies
