Hypothesis 1: Publicly traded firms will have higher growth rates than privately held firms. Hypothesis 2: Publicly traded enterprises will have a larger international scope than state- owned and privately held firms. Hypothesis 3: State-owned firms will have a greater share of the domestic market than publicly traded or privately held firms. Hypothesis 4: Publicly traded firms will have broader product lines than state-owned and privately held firms. Hypothesis 5: State-owned firms are more likely to have state-owned enterprises as customers overseas. Hypothesis 6: State-owned firms will have a higher customer-base stability than privately held firms. Hypothesis 7: In less visible contexts, publicly traded firms will employ more advanced technology than state-owned and privately held firms.
