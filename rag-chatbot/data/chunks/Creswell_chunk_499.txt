these levels—see Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). The mixing of the data from the two methods is often to integrate the information and compare one data source with the other, typically accomplished in a discussion section of a study. However, the data may also not be compared but reside side by side as two different pictures that provide an overall composite assessment of the problem. This would be the case when the researcher uses this approach to assess different research questions or different levels in an organization. Similar to the other approaches, an explicit theoretical perspective can be used in this model, typically to inform the primary method. The concurrent embedded model may be used to serve a variety of purposes. Often, this model is used so that a researcher can gain broader perspectives as a result of using the different methods as opposed to using the predominant method alone. For example, Morse (1991) noted that a primarily qualitative design could embed some quantitative data to enrich the description of the sample participants. Likewise, she described how qualitative data could be used to describe an aspect of a quantitative study that cannot be quantified. In addition, a concurrent embedded model may
