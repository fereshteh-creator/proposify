that then can be compared with themes from the qualitative database. • Explore outliers: In a sequential model, an analysis of quantitative data in the first phase can yield extreme or outlier cases. Follow-up qualitative interviews with these outlier cases can provide insight about why they diverged from the quantitative sample. • Instrument development: In a sequential approach, obtain themes and specific statements from participants in an initial qualitative data collection. In the next phase, use these statements as specific items and the themes for scales to create a survey instrument that is grounded in the views of the participants. A third, final phase might be to validate the instrument with a large sample representative of a population. • Examine multiple levels: In a concurrent embedded model, conduct a survey at one level (e.g., with families) to gather quantitative results about a sample. At the same time, collect --- Seite 201 --- qualitative interviews (e.g., with individuals) to explore the phenomenon with specific individuals in the families. • Create a matrix: When comparing data in a concurrent type of approach, combine information from both the quantitative and qualitative data collection into a matrix. The horizontal axis of this matrix could
