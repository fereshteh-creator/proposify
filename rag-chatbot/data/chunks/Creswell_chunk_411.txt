addressed adequately in qualitative books, such as participatory action research (Kemmis & Wilkinson, 1998) or discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004). For the five approaches, researchers might study individuals (narrative, phenomenology); explore processes, activities, and events (case study, grounded theory); or learn about broad culture-sharing behavior of individuals or groups (ethnography). In writing a procedure for a qualitative proposal, consider the following research tips: • Identify the specific approach to inquiry that you will be using. • Provide some background information about the strategy, such as its discipline origin, the applications of it, and a brief definition of it (see Chapter 1 for the five strategies of inquiry). • Discuss why it is an appropriate strategy to use in the proposed study. • Identify how the use of the strategy will shape the types of questions asked (see Morse, 1994, for questions that relate to strategies), the form of data collection, the steps of data analysis, and the final narrative.

This introduces a range of strategic, ethical, and personal issues into the qualitative research
