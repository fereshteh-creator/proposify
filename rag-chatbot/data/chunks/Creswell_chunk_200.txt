It is illuminating to see how people think on paper. Zinsser (1983) identified two types of writers: --- Seite 87 --- the “bricklayer,” who makes every paragraph just right before going on to the next paragraph, and the “let-it-all-hang-out-on-the-first-draft” writer, who writes an entire first draft not caring how sloppy it looks or how badly it is written. In between would be someone like Peter Elbow (Elbow, 1973), who recommends that one should go through the iterative process of writing, reviewing, and rewriting. He cites this exercise: With only 1 hour to write a passage, write four drafts (one every 15 minutes) rather than one draft (typically in the last 15 minutes) during the hour. Most experienced researchers write the first draft carefully but do not work for a polished draft; the polish comes relatively late in the writing process. • Do not edit your proposal at the early-draft stage. Instead, consider Franklin’s (1986) three- stage model, which I have found useful in developing proposals
