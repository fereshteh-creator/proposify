carries the connotation more of an abstract idea than a specifically defined term. However, social scientists typically use the term variable, and it will be employed in this discussion. Variables often measured in studies include gender, age, socioeconomic status (SES), and attitudes or behaviors such as racism, social control, political power, or leadership. Several texts provide detailed discussions about the types of variables one can use and their scales of measurement (e.g., Isaac & Michael, 1981; Keppel, 1991; Kerlinger, 1979; Thorndike, 1997). Variables are distinguished by two characteristics: temporal order and their measurement (or observation). Temporal order means that one variable precedes another in time. Because of this time ordering, it is said that one variable affects or causes another variable, though a more accurate statement would be that one variable probably causes another. When dealing with studies in the natural setting and with humans, researchers cannot absolutely prove cause and effect --- Seite 60 --- (Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991), and social scientists now say that there is probable causation. Temporal order means that quantitative researchers think about variables in an order from “left to right” (Punch, 2005) and order the variables in purpose statements, research questions, and visual models
