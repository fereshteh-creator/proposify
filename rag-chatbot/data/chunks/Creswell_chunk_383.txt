Group A O—O—O—O—X—O—O—O—O Control-Group Interrupted Time-Series Design A modification of the Single-Group Interrupted Time-Series design in which two groups of participants, not randomly assigned, are observed over time. A treatment is administered to only one of the groups (i.e., Group A).

Both groups are administered both a pre-test and a post-test, but the treatment is provided only to experimental Group A. Group A R———O———X———O Group B R——— O———————O Post-Test-Only Control-Group Design This design controls for any confounding effects of a pre-test and is a popular experimental design. The participants are randomly assigned to groups, a treatment is given only to the experimental group, and both groups are measured on the post-test.
