the effects of which are to be measured. • O represents an observation or measurement recorded on an instrument. • X’s and O’s in a given row are applied to the same specific persons. X’s and O’s in the same column, or placed vertically relative to each other, are simultaneous. • The left-to-right dimension indicates the temporal order of procedures in the experiment (sometimes indicated with an arrow). • The symbol R indicates random assignment. • Separation of parallel rows by a horizontal line indicates that comparison groups are not equal (or equated) by random assignment. No horizontal line between the groups displays random assignment of individuals to treatment groups. --- Seite 150 --- In the following examples, this notation is used to illustrate pre-experimental, quasi- experimental, true experimental, and single-subject designs. Example 8.2Pre-Experimental Designs One-Shot Case Study This design involves an exposure of a group to a treatment followed by a measure. Group A X_____________________O One-Group Pre-Test-Post-Test Design This design includes a pre-test measure followed by a treatment and a post-test for a single group. Group A 01————X————02 Static Group Comparison or Post-Test-Only With Nonequivalent Groups Experimenters use this design after implementing a treatment. After the treatment, the researcher
