He also discusses the conceptualization of a survey instrument and its scales. He then provides useful ideas about administering a questionnaire and processing the results. Also included is a discussion about data analysis with attention to constructing and understanding tables and writing a survey report. This book is detailed, informative, and technically oriented toward students at the intermediate or advanced level of survey research. Campbell, D. T., & Stanley, J. C. (1963). Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for research. In N. L. Gage (Ed.), Handbook of research on teaching (pp. 1-76). Chicago: Rand- McNally. This chapter in the Gage Handbook is the classical statement about experimental designs. Campbell and Stanley designed a notation system for experiments that is still used today; they also advanced the types of experimental designs, beginning with factors that jeopardize internal and external validity, the pre-experimental design types, true experiments, quasi- experimental designs, and correlational and ex post facto designs. The chapter presents an excellent summary of types of designs, their threats to validity, and statistical procedures to test the designs. This is an essential chapter for students beginning their study of experimental studies. Fink, A. (2002). The survey kit (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. ---
