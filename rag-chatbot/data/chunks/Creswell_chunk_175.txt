expectations. Contrary to proposition 2.1, we expected that the career stages would be similar not in type of issue but in the range of issues. Instead we found that the issues for post-tenure faculty covered almost all the possible problems on the list. Why were the tenured faculty’s needs more extensive than non-tenured faculty? The research productivity literature suggests that one’s research performance does not decline with the award of tenure (Holley 1977). Perhaps diffuse career goals of post-tenure faculty expand the possibilities for “types” of issues. In any case, this sub-proposition focuses attention on the understudied career group that Furniss (1981) reminds us needs to be examined in more detail. (Creswell & Brown, 1992, p. 58) As this example shows, we developed a visual model that interrelated variables, derived this model inductively from informant comments, and placed the model at the end of the study, where the central propositions in it could be contrasted with the existing theories and literature. MIXED METHODS THEORY USE Theory use in mixed methods studies may include theory deductively, in quantitative theory testing and verification, or inductively as in an emerging qualitative theory or pattern. A social science or a health science theory may
