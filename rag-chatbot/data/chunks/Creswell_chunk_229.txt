of data, researchers need to provide an accurate account of the information. This accuracy may require debriefing between the researcher and participants in quantitative research (Berg, 2001). It may include, in qualitative research, using one or more of the strategies to check the accuracy of the data with participants or across different data sources (see validation strategies in Chapter 9). Ethical Issues in Writing and Disseminating the Research The ethical issues do not stop with data collection and analysis; issues apply as well to the actual writing and dissemination of the final research report. For example, • Discuss how the research will not use language or words that are biased against persons because of gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic group, disability, or age. The APA (2001) Publication Manual suggests three guidelines. First, present unbiased language at an appropriate level of specificity (e.g., rather than say, “The client’s behavior was typically male,” state, “the client’s behavior was _________ [specify]”). Second, use language that is sensitive to labels (e.g., rather than “400 Hispanics”, indicate “400 Mexicans, Spaniards, and Puerto Ricans”). Third, acknowledge participants in a study (e.g., rather than “subject,” use the word “participant,” and rather than “woman doctor” use “doctor”
