a quantitative or numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a population by studying a sample of that population. Theoretical lens or perspective in qualitative research provides an overall orienting lens that is used to study questions of gender, class, and race (or other issues of marginalized groups). This lens becomes an advocacy perspective that shapes the types of questions asked, informs how data are collected and analyzed, and provides a call for action or change. Theories in mixed methods research provide an orienting lens that shapes the types of questions asked, who participates in the study, how data are collected, and the implications made from the study (typically for change and advocacy). They present an overarching perspective used with other strategies of inquiry. Theory in quantitative research is the use of an interrelated set of constructs (or variables) formed into propositions, or hypotheses, that specify the relationship among variables (typically in terms of magnitude or direction) and predicts the outcomes of a study. --- Seite 219 --- Theory use in mixed methods studies may include theory deductively in quantitative theory testing and verification or inductively, as in an emerging qualitative theory or pattern.
