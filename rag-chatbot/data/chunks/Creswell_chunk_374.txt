and controlling for their effects statistically, selecting homogeneous samples, or blocking the participants into subgroups or categories and analyzing the impact of each subgroup on the outcome (Creswell, 2008). • Tell the reader about the number of participants in each group and the systematic procedures for determining the size of each group. For experimental research, investigators use a power analysis (Lipsey, 1990) to identify the appropriate sample size for groups. This calculation involves • A consideration of the level of statistical significance for the experiment, or alpha • The amount of power desired in a study—typically presented as high, medium, or low—for the statistical test of the null hypothesis with sample data when the null hypothesis is, in fact, false --- Seite 148 --- • The effect size, the expected differences in the means between the control and experimental groups expressed in standard deviation units • Researchers set values for these three factors (e.g., alpha = .05, power = .80, and effect size = .50) and can look up in a table the size needed for each group (see Cohen, 1977; Lipsey, 1990). In this way, the experiment is planned so that the size of each treatment group provides the
