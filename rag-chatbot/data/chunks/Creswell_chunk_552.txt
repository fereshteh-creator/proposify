variables (typically in terms of magnitude or direction) and predicts the outcomes of a study. --- Seite 219 --- Theory use in mixed methods studies may include theory deductively in quantitative theory testing and verification or inductively, as in an emerging qualitative theory or pattern. Timing in mixed methods research involves collecting the quantitative and qualitative data in phases (sequentially) or gathering it at the same time (concurrently). Topic is the subject or subject matter of a proposed study that a researcher identifies early in the preparation of a study. Transformative mixed methods procedures are those in which the researcher uses a theoretical lens (see Chapter 3) as an overarching perspective within a design that contains both quantitative and qualitative data. True experiment is a form of experimental research in which individuals are randomly assigned to groups. Validity in quantitative research refers to whether one can draw meaningful and useful inferences from scores on particular instruments. Validity strategies in qualitative research are procedures (e.g., member checking, triangulating data sources) that qualitative researchers use to demonstrate the accuracy of their findings and convince readers of this accuracy. Variable refers to a characteristic or attribute of an individual or an organization that
