a transformative effect in which the “women benefited from the research project” (p. 76). The intent of the author was to provide a voice for women and to give a more powerful voice to gender inequality. The quantitative data provided the generalized patterns of participation while the qualitative data provided the personal narratives of women. The timing of the study was to first collect survey data and then interview women to follow up and understand their participation in more depth (an explanatory sequential design). The weight of the qualitative and quantitative components was equal, with the thought that both contribute to understanding the research problem. The mixing was through connecting the results from the quantitative survey and exploring these in more depth in the qualitative phase. Because feminist theory was discussed throughout the article with a focus on equality and giving voice to women, the study employed an explicit theoretical feminist lens. SUMMARY In designing the procedures for a mixed methods study, begin by conveying the nature of mixed methods research. This includes tracing its history, defining it, and mentioning its applications in many fields of research. Then, state and employ four criteria to select an appropriate mixed methods strategy.
