employing the combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches, has gained popularity. This popularity is because research methodology continues to evolve and develop, and mixed methods is another step forward, utilizing the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative research. Also, the problems addressed by social and health science researchers are complex, and the use of either quantitative or qualitative approaches by themselves is inadequate to address this complexity. The interdisciplinary nature of research, as well, contributes to the formation of research teams with individuals with diverse methodological interests and approaches. Finally, there is more insight to be gained from the combination of both qualitative and quantitative research than either form by itself. Their combined use provides an expanded understanding of research problems. This chapter brings together many of the threads introduced in the earlier chapters: It extends the discussion about the philosophical assumptions of a pragmatic philosophy, the combined use of qualitative and quantitative modes of inquiry, and the use of multiple methods introduced in Chapter 1. It also extends the discussion about research problems that incorporate the need both to explore and explain (Chapter 5). It follows a purpose statement and research questions focused on understanding a problem using both
