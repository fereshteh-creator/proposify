role to a larger study, as is found in some experimental trials (see Rogers et al., 2003). Figure 10.1 Aspects to Consider in Planning a Mixed Methods Design SOURCE: Adapted from Creswell et al. (2003). Mixing Mixing the data (and in a larger sense, mixing the research questions, philosophy, the interpretation) is difficult at best when one considers that qualitative data consists of text and images and quantitative data, numbers. There are two different questions here: When does a --- Seite 192 --- researcher mix in a mixed methods study? And how does mixing occur? The first question is much easier to answer than the second. Mixing of the two types of data might occur at several stages: the data collection, the data analysis, interpretation, or at all three phases. For proposal developers using mixed methods, it is important to discuss and present in a proposal when the mixing will occur. How the data are mixed has received considerable recent attention (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). Mixing means either that the qualitative and quantitative data are actually merged on one end of the continuum, kept separate on the other end of the continuum, or combined in some way between these
