Bachelor Degree Program Digital Business & AI  
 
Introduction 
A proposal is a concrete plan describing what, how, and with what means will be written. A proposal provides detailed 
information about the background, the problem, the objective, and the means (theoretical and methodological) used to 
achieve it. Locke, Spirduso and Silverman1 distinguish three essential functions of a proposal: 
• 
A proposal provides the supervisor with information about the goals ("Doing the Right Thing") and means 
("Doing the Thing Right") that the student intends to use to achieve them. 
• 
A proposal is a plan describing how the work will be organized. A piece of work can only be as good as its basic 
design allows. Late sparks of inspiration cannot usually save what has been overlooked in the planning phase. 
• 
A proposal provides a framework for the student to work on. 
 
Benefits for the BT 
A proposal should: 
• 
increase the quality of the BT 
• 
standardize the requirements (e.g., theory and empirical part obligatory) 
• 
enable students to use their time efficiently  
• 
give students confidence that they are on the right track. 
 
Criteria 
A good proposal should meet the following criteria: 
• 
There is a connection ("red line") between the background, objectives/questions, theory, method, and expected 
results.  
• 
The objectives and expected results seem realistic. The emergence of the results is evident from the application 
of the theoretical concepts and the method. 
• 
Introduction: The background, objectives/questions, and the relevance are clear, understandable, and delimited 
• 
Theoretical concept and method: The selection of the theoretical concept and the method is justified and 
appropriate to meet the objectives/answer the questions. 
• 
Structure: The thesis's structure and composition are comprehensible and aligned with the method. 
• 
The student is ready for the next step of the work, namely, to design and implement a theory-based method 
(e.g., survey questionnaire or interview guideline) in which the reference to theory and the research question is 
evident.
